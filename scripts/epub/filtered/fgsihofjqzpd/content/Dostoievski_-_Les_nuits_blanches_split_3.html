A sky so starry, so calm, that looking at it one involuntarily asked: Can there really be evil under such a beautiful sky? – and this thought is still a thought of youth, dear reader, of the most naive youth. But may you have a young heart for a long time!</p><p class="msonormal">Thinking of the "wicked," I thought, not without pleasure, of the way I had spent the day that had just ended. In the morning, I had been seized by an odd sadness: it seemed to me that everyone was fleeing me, abandoning me, leaving me alone. Certainly, one would be right to ask me: Who is this "everyone"? For, for eight years that I have lived in <span> Petersburg</span> , I have not succeeded in making a single friend. But what is a friend? My friend, it is <span> Petersburg</span> all of me. And if it seemed to me this morning that "everyone" was abandoning me, it is because <span> Petersburg</span> was all gone to the country. I was afraid of being alone. For three days already this fear had been growing in me, without my being able to explain it to myself, and for three days I had been wandering about the city, deeply sad, without understanding what was happening to me. At <span> Nevsky</span> , in the garden, on the quays, not a single familiar face. No doubt, not one of them knows me among these<i class="calibre6">faces</i> <i class="calibre6">de</i> <i class="calibre6">knowledge</i>, but I know them all and very particularly; I have studied these physiognomies, I know how to read their joys and sorrows, and I share them. I became very close friends (at least, almost, because we never spoke) with a little old man whom I met almost every day, at a certain hour, on the <span> Fontanka</span> . A venerable little old man, always busy arguing with himself, his left hand always agitated and, in his right, a long cane with a golden apple. If some accident prevented me from going at the usual time to the <span> Fontanka</span> I felt remorse, and said to myself: My little old man is in the dumps. We were also strongly tempted to greet each other, especially when we were both in good spirits. Not long ago, – we had spent two whole days without seeing each other, – we simultaneously made the same gesture to grab our hats. But we remembered in time that we did not know each other and exchanged only a sympathetic look.</p><p class="msonormal">I am also on very good terms with the houses. When I pass, each one runs to meet me, looks at me out of all its windows, and says: "Good morning! How are you? I, thank God, am doing well. In May they will add a floor to me." Or else: "How is your health? Tomorrow they will repair me." Or else: "I almost burned down, God! I was so scared!" etc. Besides, I do not love them all equally, I have my preferences. Among my best friends, I know one who intends to take, this summer, a cure with the architect: I will certainly come every day in her street, on purpose to see if they do not treat her too much, for those doctors!... God bless her!</p><p class="msonormal">But I shall never forget my adventure with a very pretty little house of tender pink, a tiny stone house that looked at me with such affection and had for its neighbors, mean and badly built, so much evident contempt, that I was delighted every time I passed by it. One day, my poor friend said to me with inexpressible sadness: "They are painting me yellow! The brigands! The barbarians! They spare nothing, neither the columns nor the balustrades... " and indeed my friend turned yellow like a lemon. One would have said that bile was spreading through her body! I no longer had the courage to go and see her, the poor pretty one thus disfigured, my poor friend painted in the colors of the Celestial Empire!...</p><p class="msonormal">You now understand, reader, how I know everything. <span> Petersburg</span> .</p><p class="msonormal">I have already told you of the three days of anxiety I spent trying to find the causes of the strange state of mind in which I found myself. I felt ill at ease everywhere, neither in the street nor at home. What is it that I lack? I thought, why am I so uncomfortable? And I was surprised to notice, for the first time, the ugliness of my smoky walls and the ceiling where <span> Matrona</span> cultivated spider webs with great success. I examined my furniture, piece by piece, asking myself in front of each one: Isn't that where the misfortune is? (For, in normal times, it was enough for a chair to be placed differently than the night before for me to be beside myself.) Then I looked out the window... Nothing, no new cause of boredom. I imagined calling <span> Matryona</span> and to make some paternal reproaches to her about her general filthiness and the cobwebs in particular; but she looked at me in amazement, and that was all I got out of her; she left the room without saying a single word to me. And the cobwebs will never disappear.</p><p class="msonormal">It was only this morning that I understood what it was all about: ha! ha! but... they have all gone to the country!... (Pardon me for this trivial word, I am not trying to be grand.) Yes, all <span> Petersburg</span> is in the country... And immediately every respectable gentleman, I mean one who looked respectable, who passed by in a cab, was transformed in my eyes into an estimable father of a family who, after his usual occupations, was going lightly to his family home in the country. All the passers-by, for three days, had changed their demeanor and everything about them said clearly: We are only passing through here, and in two hours we will be gone.</p><p class="msonormal">If a window opened in my street, where first little fingers white as sugar had drummed, then a pretty girl's head had come out calling for the flower-seller, it did not seem to me at all that the girl intended to make herself an intimate springtime with these flowers in her stuffy St. Petersburg apartment, it meant on the contrary: "These flowers! Ah! soon, I will take them back to the fields!"</p><p class="msonormal">More than that, – for I have made progress in my new discovery, – I can already, by the exterior appearance alone, discern in what villa such a person lives. The inhabitants of <span> Kamenni</span> , of the islands <span> Aptekarsky</span> or the road to <span> Petergov</span> , are distinguished by their refined manners, elegant summer suits, and pretty cars. The inhabitants of Pargolovo and beyond have a particular character of wisdom and good behavior. Those of the islands <span> Krestovsky</span> have an imperturbable gaiety.</p><p class="msonormal">If I met a procession of carters walking lazily, holding the reins in both hands, beside their carts loaded with mountains of furniture, tables, chairs, Turkish and non-Turkish sofas, household utensils, all of which was often topped by a cook who, sitting on top of the pile, guarded her masters' belongings; if I watched boats also loaded with furniture glide along the Neva: carts and boats multiplied in my eyes, it seemed to me that the whole city was leaving, that everything was moving in caravans, that the city was going to be deserted. I was saddened and offended. For I could not go to the country! I was ready to leave with every cart, with every<i class="calibre6">Mr.</i>a little well-to-do who rented a car. But not one, not a single one invited me. It was as if they all forgot me, as if I were a stranger to them!</p><p class="msonormal">I walked a long time, so long that I ended up not knowing where I was, when I saw the fortifications. Immediately I felt happy. I went through fields and meadows, I did not feel any fatigue. It even seemed to me that a heavy burden was falling from my soul. All the people in carriages looked at me with so much sympathy that a little more they would have greeted me. Everyone was happy, I do not know why; everyone smoked beautiful cigars. I was happy. I thought I was suddenly transported to Italy, so much nature surprised me, poor city dweller half sick, half dead from the poisoned atmosphere of the city.</p><p class="msonormal">There is something ineffably touching about our Petersburg countryside when, in the spring, it suddenly unfolds all its strength, blossoms, adorns itself, and garlands itself with flowers. It reminds me of those languid, anemic young girls who arouse only pity, sometimes indifference, and suddenly, from one day to the next, become <span> inexpressibly</span> You see a woman, a young girl, who is marvelously beautiful: you stand amazed before her, wondering what power has put this unexpected fire in these sad, pensive eyes, who has colored these pale cheeks with a rosy hue, who has spread this passion over these features that were without expression, why do these young breasts rise and fall so deeply? My God! who could have given this poor girl this strength, this sudden fullness of life, this beauty? Who has thrown this lightning into this smile? Who thus makes this gaiety sparkle? You look around you, you look for someone, you guess... But let the hours pass and perhaps tomorrow you will find the sad, pensive look of the past, the same pale face, the same timid, effaced manners: it is the seal of sorrow, of repentance, it is also the regret of the ephemeral blossoming... and you lament that this beauty has faded so quickly: what! you have not even had time to love it!...</p><p class="msonormal">I did not get back to the city until quite late; it was ten o'clock. The road ran along the canal; it is a deserted place at that hour... Yes, I live in the most remote suburb.</p><p class="msonormal">I was walking along singing. When I am happy I always hum to myself. It is, I believe, the habit of men who, having neither friends nor comrades, do not know with whom to share a moment of joy.</p><p class="msonormal">But that evening was to bring me an adventure.</p><p class="msonormal">Standing apart, leaning on the parapet of the canal, I noticed a woman. She seemed to be examining the murky water attentively. She wore a charming hat with yellow flowers and a coquettish black mantilla.</p><p class="msonormal">"It is a young girl, and certainly a brunette," I thought.</p><p class="msonormal">She seemed not to hear my steps, and did not move when I passed by her, holding my breath and with my heart beating very fast.</p><p class="msonormal">"That's strange," I thought. "She must be very preoccupied."</p><p class="msonormal">And suddenly I stopped, as if I had heard muffled sobs.</p><p class="msonormal">"I am not mistaken, she is crying."</p><p class="msonormal">A moment of silence, then another sob. My God! My heart ached. I am usually very shy with women, but in such a moment!... I turned back, approached her, and would certainly have uttered the word: "Madame," if I had not remembered in time that this word is used at least in a thousand analogous circumstances by all our worldly novelists. That was the only thing that stopped me, and I was looking for a rarer word when the young girl saw me, straightened up, and quickly slipped past me along the canal. I immediately began to follow her. But she noticed it, left the quay, crossed the street, and took the sidewalk. I did not dare cross the street in turn, my heart was beating in my chest like a caged bird. Fortunately, chance came to my aid.</p><p class="msonormal">A gentleman in a frock coat, of a "serious" age, suddenly appeared on the sidewalk where the stranger was walking, and very close to her. One could not say, for example, that his gait was serious either. He was swaying, carefully skirting the walls. The young girl was running as fast as she could, with a step that was both hurried and fearful, as all young girls do when they want to avoid being offered an escort; and certainly, with his unsteady gait, the gentleman whose shadow was swaying on the walls would not have been able to catch up with her if he had not suddenly started to run. She was going like the wind, but her pursuer was gaining ground, he was already very close to her, she cried out, and... I thanked destiny for the excellent stick I was holding in my right hand. In an instant I was on the other side, the gentleman took into consideration the irrefutable argument I proposed to him, fell silent, retreated, and only when we had distanced ourselves from him did he start to protest in rather energetic terms; but his words were lost in the air.</p><p class="msonormal">“Take my arm,” I said to the unknown woman.</p><p class="msonormal">She silently slipped her trembling hand under my arm, still frightened. Oh, the unexpected gentleman! How I blessed him!</p><p class="msonormal">I cast a rapid glance at her. She was dark, as I had guessed, and very pretty. Her eyes were still wet with tears, but her lips were smiling. She glanced at me furtively, blushed a little, and lowered her eyes.</p><p class="msonormal">“You see! Why did you push me away? If I had been there, nothing would have happened…”</p><p class="msonormal">"But I didn't know you, I thought you were too..."</p><p class="msonormal">– Do you know me better now?</p><p class="msonormal">– A little. For example, you are trembling, do you think I do not know why?</p><p class="msonormal">“Oh! you guessed it right away!” I exclaimed, delighted that the young girl was so intelligent, for intelligence and beauty go very well together. “Yes, you guessed who you were dealing with. It's true, I'm shy with women. I'm even more excited now than you were when that gentleman scared you. It's like a dream... No, it's more than a dream, because I never, even in a dream, talk to a woman.</p><p class="msonormal">– What are you saying? Really?</p><p class="msonormal">– Yes. If my arm trembles, it is because never before has such a pretty little hand rested on it. I am not at all used to women... I have always lived alone. So I do not know how to talk to them. Perhaps I have already said something foolish to you; speak frankly, you can, I am not touchy...</p><p class="msonormal">“You have not said anything foolish, quite the contrary, and since you want me to speak frankly, I will tell you that such timidity pleases women, and if you want to know everything I will tell you again that it pleases me particularly. So I allow you to accompany me to my door.</p><p class="msonormal">“But,” I said, choking with joy, “you will tell me so much that I shall cease to be shy, and then, goodbye to all my advantages...”</p><p class="msonormal">– Advantages! What advantages? Why do that? That's not right.</p><p class="msonormal">– Pardon... But how do you expect me not to desire...</p><p class="msonormal">– To please, isn't it?</p><p class="msonormal">“Well, yes. Yes, be kind, for God's sake! Listen. I'm twenty-six years old and no one has ever loved me. How could I possibly speak cleverly and appropriately? Yet I must speak, I want to tell you everything, you... My heart is crying out, I can't keep silent... But would you believe it... not a single woman, never, never... and not a friend! and every day I dream that I'm finally going to meet someone, I dream, I dream... and if you only knew how many times I've been in love in this way!</p><p class="msonormal">– But how? From whom?</p><p class="msonormal">– From no one, ideally. They are figures of women glimpsed in dreams. My dreams are whole novels. Oh! you don't know me... It is true, – and it could not be otherwise, – I have met two or three women, but what women! Ah! the eternal pot-au-feu!... But you would laugh if I told you that I have several times dreamed that I was talking, in the street, to a lady of the highest society. Yes, in the street, simply: the lady was alone and I spoke to her respectfully, timidly, passionately. I told her: that I am lost in solitude, that she must not send me away, that no woman loves me, that it is the duty of women not to reject the prayer of a wretch, that I ask her at most two words of sister, two compassionate words, that she must therefore listen to me, that she can laugh at me if she pleases, but that she must listen to me, that she must give me back the hope I have lost... Two words, only two words and then never see her again!... But you laugh... Besides what I say is indeed very funny.</p><p class="msonormal">– Don't be angry. What makes me laugh is that you are your own enemy. If you tried, you might succeed, even if the scene were played out in the street. The simpler it is, the more certain it is. No woman of heart, provided she were not stupid or, at that very moment, in a bad mood, would dare refuse you the two words you implore. Yet, who knows? Perhaps you would be taken for a madman. I judged by myself, – for I know well how people live on earth...</p><p class="msonormal">“Oh! I thank you,” I cried. “You cannot understand the good you have done me!”</p><p class="msonormal">“Very well, very well. But tell me, how did you see that I am a woman with whom... well, a woman worthy... worthy... of attention and friendship? In a word, not... pot-au-feu, as you say? Why did you decide to approach me?”</p><p class="msonormal">– Why? But... you were alone, this gentleman too enterprising... it was night, you must admit it was a duty...</p><p class="msonormal">– But no, before that, there, on the other side, you wanted to approach me...</p><p class="msonormal">“There, on the other side?... But really, I don't know how to answer you, I'm afraid... You know? I felt very happy today. The walk, the songs I remembered, the countryside... I've never felt so good. You see... it seemed to me perhaps... forgive me if I remind you, I thought I heard you crying, and I... I couldn't bear it, my heart ached. Oh my God! Was I guilty of having a fraternal pity for you!... Could I have offended you by approaching you despite myself?</p><p class="msonormal">“Hush,” said the young girl, lowering her eyes and pressing my hand. “I was wrong to speak of that, but I am glad I was not mistaken in you. Well, here I am at home. You have to cross this little alley, and then it is only two steps. Good-bye. Thank you.”</p><p class="msonormal">– So we'll never see each other again, it's over?</p><p class="msonormal">“You see!” said the young girl, laughing, “you only wanted two words at first, and now… Besides, we may meet again perhaps…”</p><p class="msonormal">"I will come here tomorrow... Oh! excuse me, I am already demanding."</p><p class="msonormal">– Yes, you have no patience, you almost order...</p><p class="msonormal">“Listen to me,” I interrupted, “I cannot help coming here tomorrow. I am a dreamer, I have so little real life, I have so few moments like this, that I cannot help reliving them in my dreams. I will dream of you all night, all week, all year. I will come here tomorrow, absolutely, precisely here, tomorrow, at the same time and I will be happy to remember the day before there... This place is already dear to me. “I have two or three places like this in <span> Petersburg</span> . In one of them I cried... from a memory. Who knows? Ten minutes ago, perhaps you too were crying for some memory. Perhaps in the past you were very happy here?</p><p class="msonormal">"I may come tomorrow at ten o'clock, too," she said. "I see that I can no longer refuse you. But you must not come here. Don't think that I am making an appointment with you; I only foresee that I shall have to come here on business, but... well, frankly, I should not be sorry if you came here too. In the first place, I may have some more unpleasantness like today, but let us leave that... In a word, I should like to see you simply... to say a few words to you. Don't think ill of me for that. Don't think that I give appointments so easily; I should not have told you this if... but it must be a secret, that is the condition..."</p><p class="msonormal">"A convention," said she, "say at once that it is a condition! I consent to everything," I exclaimed, transported, "to everything, I answer for myself, I will be obedient, respectful... you know me."</p><p class="msonormal">"It is precisely because I know you that I invite you tomorrow; but you, take care of this other absolutely capital condition (I will speak frankly to you): do not fall in love with me, it is not possible, I assure you; for friendship I am willing, here is my hand; but love, no, I beg you.</p><p class="msonormal">"I swear to you..."</p><p class="msonormal">– Don't swear, you are as inflammable as gunpowder... Don't be angry with me for telling you this, if you knew... I too have no one in the world to confide in, to ask for advice; you are an exception, I know you as if we were friends of twenty years... won't you betray me?</p><p class="msonormal">– You'll see! But how to live through this long day?</p><p class="msonormal">– Sleep well, good night, and remember that I already trust you. Tell me, one does not have to account for all one's feelings, even a fraternal sympathy? It was you who told me that, and you said it so well that the thought immediately came to me to confide in you and tell you...</p><p class="msonormal">– What, my God! say what?</p><p class="msonormal">"Tomorrow! Let this remain a secret until tomorrow! It will be better for you! It will be more like a novel! Perhaps I will tell you tomorrow... everything, and perhaps I will tell you nothing! I want to talk to you first, to get to know you better."</p><p class="msonormal">"I will tell you all my story tomorrow," I said with determination. "But what is it? Something wonderful is happening to me. Where am I? My God! Well, aren't you glad now that you didn't get angry just now, that you didn't push me away at the first word? In two minutes you have made me happy for the rest of my life, yes, happy! You have reconciled me with myself! You have perhaps cleared up all my doubts! If I have more moments like these... Well, I will tell you everything tomorrow, you will know everything, everything..."</p><p class="msonormal">– So you'll start?</p><p class="msonormal">– Understood.</p><p class="msonormal">– Good-bye!</p><p class="msonormal">– Goodbye!</p><p class="msonormal">And we parted. I wandered all night, I could not bring myself to go home...</p><p class="msonormal">"Tomorrow!"</p> <span> </span> </body></html>
