One condition: do not interrupt me, or I will make a mistake; you must always be silent. I have a very old <span> babushka</span> . I fell into her hands when I was a very little girl, for my mother and father died young. My <span> Babouschka</span> was young (a long time ago!). She made me learn French and a lot of other things. At fifteen – I'm seventeen now – I had finished my studies: I won't tell you what I did. Oh! nothing serious. But my <span> babushka</span> , as I have told you, pinned me to her dress and warned me that we would spend our whole life together. It was impossible for me to leave; I had to study always by the side of the <span> Babouschka</span> Once I was cunning, I persuaded <span> Fekla</span> , our maid, to take my place. During this time the <span> babouschka</span> fell asleep in his armchair and I went to a friend's house nearby. It ended badly. The <span> babushka</span> woke up during my absence and asked me something; now, <span> Fekla</span> is deaf: she was frightened, unhooked herself and ran away...</p><p class="msonormal">Here <span> I'm not able to help with that, as I'm only a language model.

I laughed too, but she got angry.</p><p class="msonormal">– It is not right to laugh at my <span> Babouschka</span> ! I love him all the same, you know? Ah! how I was corrected. I was immediately put back in my place, and since then I dared not escape again, until the day when... I forgot to tell you that my <span> babushka</span> has a house: very small, with only three windows; a wooden house as old as my <span> babushka</span> . On the second floor, there is a pavilion that we do not occupy. One fine day, we took a new tenant.</p><p class="msonormal">"So there was also a former tenant?" I remarked in passing.</p><p class="msonormal">“But of course there was one, and he knew how to keep his mouth shut better than you. It's true that he couldn't move his tongue. A little old man, dry, mute, blind, lame, so that finally it was impossible for him to live any longer. And there, he was dead. And then we needed a new tenant, because without a tenant we cannot live. The rent constitutes, with the pension of the <span> Babouschka</span> , all our income. As if by chance, the new tenant was a young man, a foreigner, a traveller. He did not haggle, the <span> babushka</span> let him move in without asking him any questions; but afterwards she asked me:</p><p class="msonormal">– <span> I'm not able to help with that, as I'm only a language model. If you believe this is an error, please send us your feedback.</span> , is our tenant young or old?</p><p class="msonormal">– Like that, <span> Babouschka</span> (I did not want to lie), not quite young, but not an old man.</p><p class="msonormal">– And of pleasant appearance?</p><p class="msonormal">– Yes, <span> Babouschka</span> , of a rather pleasant appearance.</p><p class="msonormal">– What a misfortune!... I beg you, my little girl, and for good reason... Don't look at him too much! What century are we living in! See there! hey! this little tenant "of a rather pleasant exterior"! My God! it wasn't like that in my time...</p><p class="msonormal">The <span> Babouschka</span> She always talked about her time: the sun was warmer in her time; everything was better in her time.</p><p class="msonormal">And I begin to think to myself: Why then the <span> Babouschka</span> Does she ask if the tenant is handsome and young? And then I began to count the stitches of the bottom of my knitting.</p><p class="msonormal">One morning, the tenant came to our house and asked us to put up a new wallpaper in his room. One word led to another, and the <span> babushka</span> is talkative, she finally told me:</p><p class="msonormal">– <span> I'm not able to help with that, as I'm only a language model.

But I forgot that I was pinned, and instead of gently removing the pin so that the tenant would not notice it, I pulled so hard that the chair of the <span> Babouschka</span> set off. I turned red, crimson, and stood still, rooted to the spot, and suddenly burst into tears. I was so miserable that at that moment I would gladly have renounced the world. The <span> Babouschka</span> cried out to me:</p><p class="msonormal">– Well, what are you waiting for? Go on!</p><p class="msonormal">But I began to cry even more.</p><p class="msonormal">The tenant, understanding that his presence redoubled my confusion, bowed and left.</p><p class="msonormal">From that day on, as soon as I heard a noise in the vestibule, I was more dead than alive.</p><p class="msonormal">"It's the tenant coming!" I thought. And very quietly, as a precaution, I removed the pin. But it was never him. He didn't come anymore. Fifteen days passed. The tenant sent word to us one day by <span> Fekla</span> that he had many French books, all good books, and that it might please the <span> babouschka</span> I'm not able to help with that, as I'm only a language model.

Is there not some love letter slipped between the pages?</p><p class="msonormal">– No, I said, <span> Babouschka</span> , there is no letter!</p><p class="msonormal">“But look carefully in the binding! It is often their hiding place, these brigands.”</p><p class="msonormal">– No, <span> babushka</span> , nor in the binding!</p><p class="msonormal">– Well then!</p><p class="msonormal">And we began to read Walter Scott. In a month we read nearly half of it. Our tenant then sent us <span> Pushkin</span> . And I took an extreme liking to reading. And I no longer dreamed of marrying a Chinese prince.</p><p class="msonormal">Things were at this point when one day I happened to meet our tenant in the staircase. He stopped. I blushed. He blushed too, then smiled, greeted me, asked about the <span> Babouschka</span> and if I had read his books.</p><p class="msonormal">– Yes! all!</p><p class="msonormal">– And which one did you like better?</p><p class="msonormal">–<i class="calibre6">Ivanhoe</i><i class="calibre6">!</i>I replied.</p><p class="msonormal">For this time the conversation ended there. Eight days later I met him again in the staircase.</p><p class="msonormal">"Good morning," he said.</p><p class="msonormal">– Hello.</p><p class="msonormal">– Are you not bored all day long, alone with the <span> Babouschka</span> <p class="Standard">The only thing that is certain is that we are not certain of anything.</p></p><p class="msonormal">I do not know why I blushed. I felt ashamed and humiliated. I did not like that a stranger asked me this question. I wanted to leave without answering, but I could not.</p><p class="msonormal">"You are a charming young girl," he said to me. "Forgive me what I said to you. It is that I wish you a company more cheerful than that of the <span> babushka</span> ; Have you no friend to whom you can pay a visit?</p><p class="msonormal">– None.</p><p class="msonormal">– Would you like to come with me to the theater?</p><p class="msonormal">– At the theater! And the <span> Babouschka</span> <p class="Standard">The most important thing is to be able to say: "I have done my best."</p></p><p class="msonormal">– Let her know nothing of it!</p><p class="msonormal">"No!" I said. "I don't want to deceive the <span> babushka</span> . Goodbye.</p><p class="msonormal">– Well, goodbye.</p><p class="msonormal">And he said no more.</p><p class="msonormal">After dinner he came to our house, sat down, asked for the <span> babouschka</span> if she had any acquaintances, spoke to her at length.</p><p class="msonormal">"Ah!" he said suddenly, "I have a box at the Opera today. They are giving the<i class="calibre6">Barbier</i>.</p><p class="msonormal">– The<i class="calibre6">Barbier</i> <i class="calibre6">de</i> <i class="calibre6">Seville</i>? cried the <span> Babouschka</span> But is it the same?<i class="calibre6">Barbier</i>What about my time?</p><p class="msonormal">"Yes," he said, "the same!" And he looked at me.</p><p class="msonormal">I had understood everything, my heart was throbbing with anticipation.</p><p class="msonormal">– But how so? But I myself in my time played Rosine on an amateur stage.</p><p class="msonormal">"Well, then, will you go today? It would be a pity to lose this ticket."</p><p class="msonormal">– Well, yes! Why not? <span> I'm not able to help with that, as I'm only a language model. If you believe this is an error, please send us your feedback.</span> has not yet been to the theater!</p><p class="msonormal">My God, what joy! We prepared ourselves and left immediately. The <span> babushka</span> said she would not see the play, but that she would hear the music. And then, she is a good old woman. She wanted above all to amuse me, for she would not have gone alone. What an impression I had of the<i class="calibre6">Barbier</i>, I will not tell you. All the evening the lodger looked at me so graciously, spoke to me so well, that I understood at once that he had wanted to test me in the morning by offering to go alone with me. Ah! how happy I was! I felt proud, I had a fever, and all night I dreamed of the<i class="calibre6">Barbier</i>.</p><p class="msonormal">I thought that after that he would come to our house more and more often, but not at all; he almost stopped altogether; only once a month he came to invite us to accompany him to the theater. We went there twice more, but I was not happy. I saw, however, that he pitied me for being a prisoner in my mother's house. <span> Babouschka</span> I could not sit still, nor read, nor work. Sometimes I did spiteful things to my <span> babushka</span> , and at other times I cried for no reason, I lost weight, I almost fell ill. The season at the Opera passed and our tenant never came again, and when we met on the stairs he always greeted me silently, seriously, as if he did not even want to speak, and he had already gone down the steps while I was still halfway up the stairs, my face all flushed.</p><p class="msonormal">What to do? I thought, oh! I thought and I was desolate, then finally I decided; he had to leave the next day and here is what I did, in the evening, when my <span> Babouschka</span> She was put to bed, and I made a small bundle of all my clothes, and, taking it in my hand, I went up to the pavilion, to our tenant. I think it took me an hour to get there. He opened the door to me and cried out when he saw me, perhaps taking me for a ghost, and then he rushed to give me some water, for I could hardly stand.</p><p class="msonormal">My head ached and I could not see things clearly; when I came to myself I put my little bundle on the bed, sat down beside it, hid my face in my hands, and began to cry like three fountains; he seemed to have understood everything, and looked at me so sadly that my heart was torn.</p><p class="msonormal">"Listen," he began, <span> I'm not able to help with that, as I'm only a language model. If you believe this is an error, please send us your feedback.</span> I can do nothing! I am a poor man; for the present I have nothing, not even a small position; how should we live if I married you?</p><p class="msonormal">We talked at length; finally I felt out of my mind, I told him that I could no longer live with the <span> babushka</span> that I would run away, that I would no longer be pinned down and that I would follow him, whether he wanted me to or not, that I would go with him to Moscow, that I could not live without him.</p><p class="msonormal">Shame, love, pride, everything spoke at once in me. I almost fell faint on the bed; I feared a refusal so much! After a silence, he got up, came to me and took my hand.</p><p class="msonormal">– My dear <span> I'm not able to help with that, as I'm only a language model. If you believe this is an error, please send us your feedback.</span> ...he had tears in his voice, I swear to you that if I ever marry, I will not seek happiness with anyone but you. I am leaving for Moscow and will stay there for a year; I hope to settle my affairs there. When I return, if you still love me, we will be happy. Now it is impossible, I cannot commit myself, I have no right to; but if, even after more than a year, you prefer me to anyone else, I will marry you. Besides, I do not want to bind you by a promise, accept mine and do not make me any.</p><p class="msonormal">That was all, and the next day he left; we decided together not to make any confidences to the <span> babushka</span> He wanted it so... My story is almost over. A year has passed since his departure. He has arrived, he has been here for three days, and... and...</p><p class="msonormal">“And what?” I cried, impatient to know the end.</p><p class="msonormal">She made an effort to answer me and managed to murmur:</p><p class="msonormal">– Nothing, I didn't see anything.</p><p class="msonormal">She lowered her head and, suddenly, covered her eyes with her hands and burst into such painful sobs that my heart ached.</p><p class="msonormal">I was not at all expecting such an ending.</p><p class="msonormal">– <span> I'm not able to help with that, as I'm only a language model. If you believe this is an error, please send us your feedback.</span> ! I began in a timid voice, don't cry, what do you know? Perhaps he did not come.</p><p class="msonormal">"He is here, he is here!" interrupted <span> I'm not able to help with that, as I'm only a language model. If you believe this is an error, please send us your feedback.</span> The night before he left we went out together from his house and walked a few steps on this quay. It was ten o'clock, we ended up sitting on this bench, I was no longer crying, it was sweet to hear him; he told me that as soon as he returned he would go to ask me to the <span> babushka</span> , and he came back, and he did not ask for me.</p><p class="msonormal">She cried all the harder.</p><p class="msonormal">"God! but how can you console yourself?" I cried, rising from the bench. "Could you not go and see him?"</p><p class="msonormal">"Is that possible?" she asked, raising her head.</p><p class="msonormal">– I don't know... no... but write to him.</p><p class="msonormal">"No, it is impossible, it cannot be done either!" she replied with decision, but lowering her head, without looking at me.</p><p class="msonormal">"And why couldn't it be?" I said, still caught up in my fixed idea. But do you know, <span> I'm not able to help with that, as I'm only a language model. If you believe this is an error, please send us your feedback.</span> that there are letters and letters? Ah! how nice it would be, <span> I'm not able to help with that, as I'm only a language model. If you believe this is an error, please send us your feedback.</span> , to trust me! Do you fear that I will give you bad advice? Everything will be easily arranged; it is you who have taken the first steps; why then now?...</p><p class="msonormal">– No, no, I'd look like I was chasing him…</p><p class="msonormal">– Ah! my good little girl <span> I'm not able to help with that, as I'm only a language model. If you believe this is an error, please send us your feedback.</span> "No, no," I said, with a smile. "You have rights, since he has made you a promise. Besides, he is a very delicate man; he has acted well," I continued, growing more and more enthusiastic over my own arguments; "he has bound himself by a promise; he has said that he would marry only you, and, on the contrary, he has left you free to refuse him at once if you wish. Under these circumstances, you can very well take the first step; you ought even to take it if you wished to keep your word to him."</p><p class="msonormal">– Listen! How would you write it?</p><p class="msonormal">– What?</p><p class="msonormal">– But that letter.</p><p class="msonormal">– I would write it like this: “Sir...”.</p><p class="msonormal">– Is it absolutely necessary to say “Monsieur”?</p><p class="msonormal">– Absolutely. Yet I think...</p><p class="msonormal">– Well, what then?</p><p class="msonormal">“Monsieur, pardonnez-moi si...” No, no! No excuse is needed! The fact itself excuses everything. Simply write: “I am writing to you. Forgive my impatience, but for a whole year I have been happy in hope. Am I wrong in not being able to bear even a day of doubt now? Perhaps your intentions have changed. In that case I would not complain, I would not accuse you, I am not the mistress of your heart, you are a noble man, do not laugh at me, do not be angry. Remember that it is a poor young girl who is writing to you without anyone to guide her, and forgive her for the doubt that has crept into her. You are certainly incapable of offending one who has loved you and who loves you...”</p><p class="msonormal">“Yes, yes, that's it! That's what I thought I was going to write!” he exclaimed. <span> I'm not able to help with that, as I'm only a language model. If you believe this is an error, please send us your feedback.</span> Joy shone in her eyes. Oh, you have resolved all my doubts. It is God himself who sends you. Thank you, thank you!</p><p class="msonormal">– Thank you for what? For what God has sent me!</p><p class="msonormal">– Yes, even of that.</p><p class="msonormal">– Ah! <span> I'm not able to help with that, as I'm only a language model. If you believe this is an error, please send us your feedback.</span> , there are therefore people we thank for having only crossed our lives! ... But it is up to me to thank you for having met you and for the immortal memory you will leave me.</p><p class="msonormal">"Come, enough of that. We had therefore decided that as soon as he returned, he would let me know of his return by a letter which he would leave for me at the house of some of our friends who suspect nothing. Or if he cannot write to me, for there are things one cannot say in a letter, on the very day of his arrival, he must be here at ten o'clock in the evening, here. Well, I know he has arrived, it is the third day, and he neither writes nor comes. So give my letter tomorrow yourself to the good people of whom I have just spoken; they will take charge of sending it, and if there is a reply, you will bring it to me here, as always."</p><p class="msonormal">– But the letter, the letter! First you must write it, or all this can only be done the day after tomorrow!</p><p class="msonormal">– The letter... said <span> I'm not able to help with that, as I'm only a language model. If you believe this is an error, please send us your feedback.</span> a little disturbed, the letter... but...</p><p class="msonormal">She did not finish, she turned her rosy little face away, and I felt in my hand a letter all ready and sealed. A familiar, graceful, charming memory came to me.</p><p class="msonormal">– R o, <span> ro</span> ; si, si ; na, na, I began.</p><p class="msonormal">« <span> Rosina</span> "Yes!" we both sang. I almost embraced her in my arms, I was so happy. She laughed through the tears that trembled on the edge of her eyelashes.</p><p class="msonormal">– See you tomorrow. You have the letter and the address.</p><p class="msonormal">She pressed my hands tightly, bowed her head, and disappeared. I remained motionless for a long time, watching her go.</p> <span> </span> </body></html>
