<h2 class="calibre7" id="h224">I</h2>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3034">The next day after the fatal day on which Pyotr Petrovitch had had his explanation with the ladies, his ideas became clearer, and to his extreme astonishment he found that the rupture, which he had looked upon as so terrible, had been accomplished without any great difficulty. The black snake of wounded vanity had gnawed at his heart all night. When he got out of bed, Pyotr Petrovitch's first act was to look in the mirror. He was afraid of what he might see there, but his appearance reassured him. He looked pale and thin, but his eyes were bright and his complexion was not bad. He fancied that his nose was a little thinner, and his temples looked hollower than before. He had not slept all night, and his hair had not been combed. He had not washed his face, and he had not put on his cravat. He had spent the whole night in thinking, and he had come to the conclusion that he was a man ruined and disgraced, a man who had lost all sense of shame.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3035">Fortunately, this apprehension was not justified. Considering his pale and distinguished face, he even consoled himself for an instant by the thought that he would not be embarrassed to replace Dounia, and, who knows? perhaps advantageously. But he did not long banish this chimerical hope, and he threw a vigorous jet of saliva to one side, which brought a mocking smile to the lips of his young friend and roommate, André Semenovitch Lebeziatnikoff.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3036">Pierre Petrovitch noticed this silent mockery and put it down to his young friend, a score which had been pretty heavily charged for some time. His anger redoubled when he reflected that he ought not to have spoken of this affair to Andrei Semenovitch. It was the second piece of folly that his anger had made him commit the night before: he had yielded to the need to pour out the excess of his irritation.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3037">All that morning bad luck seemed to dog Luzhin. Even at the Senate, the business he was engaged in ended in a fiasco. What annoyed him most was his inability to make the landlord of the apartment he had rented for his forthcoming marriage listen to reason. This individual, a German by birth, was a former workman who had made his fortune. He would not accept any compromise and demanded the full payment of the penalty stipulated in the contract, although Pyotr Petrovitch was returning the apartment almost as good as new.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3038">The upholsterer was no less inflexible. He claimed to keep every last rouble of the deposit he had received on the sale of furniture that Pyotr Petrovich had not yet taken delivery of. "Will I have to marry just for my furniture?" the unfortunate businessman said to himself, gritting his teeth. At the same time, a last hope crossed his mind: "Is it possible that the evil is without remedy? Is there nothing more to try?" The memory of Dounia's charms had sunk into his heart like a thorn. It was a hard time for him to pass, and no doubt, if he could, by a simple wish, have Raskolnikov die, Pyotr Petrovich would have killed him immediately.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3039">"Another stupid thing I did was not to give them any money," he thought, as he sadly returned to Lebeziatnikoff's room; "why the devil was I so stingy? It was a bad calculation!... By leaving them temporarily in need, I thought I was preparing them to see me later as a savior, and now they are slipping through my fingers!... No, if I had given them, for example, fifteen hundred roubles, enough to buy a trousseau, if I had bought them some gifts at the English Shop, this conduct would have been both more noble and... more skillful! They would not have let me go so easily as they did! With their principles, they would certainly have felt obliged to return to me, in case of a break, gifts and money, but this restitution would have been painful and difficult for them! And then, it would have been a matter of conscience for them: how, they would have said to themselves, to throw out in this way a man who has shown himself so generous and so delicate?... Hum! I made a mistake!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3040">Pierre Petrovitch again ground his teeth and called himself a fool… in his own mind, of course.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3041">Having come to this conclusion about himself, he returned home in a much worse mood than he had left. However, his curiosity was aroused to a certain extent by the bustle caused by the preparations for the dinner at Madame Ivanovna's. He had already heard about this dinner the day before, and even remembered that he had been invited, but his own preoccupations had prevented him from paying attention to it.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3042">In the absence of Catherine Ivanovna (who was at the cemetery), Madame Lippevechzel bustled about the table, which was laid for dinner. In conversation with the landlady, Pierre Petrovitch learned that it was a regular dinner party, to which almost all the lodgers in the house had been invited, and among them several who had not known the deceased; even Andrei Semenovitch Lebeziatnikoff had received an invitation, in spite of his quarrel with Catherine Ivanovna. Finally, it would be considered a great honor if Pierre Petrovitch would consent to grace the feast with his presence, as he was the most distinguished of all the lodgers.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3043">Catherine Ivanovna, forgetting all her grievances against her landlady, had thought it her duty to send her a proper invitation; so Amalia Ivanovna was now preparing dinner with a certain amount of pleasure. Besides, Madame Lippevechsel had made a grand toilette, and, though she was in mourning, she took great pleasure in showing off a brand-new silk dress. Pyotr Petrovitch, informed of all these details, had an idea, and went back to his room, or rather to Andrei Semenovitch Lebeziatnikov's room, in a thoughtful mood. He had just learned that Raskolnikov was one of the guests.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3044">That day, for some reason or other, Andrei Semenovich spent the whole morning with him. Between this gentleman and Pyotr Petrovich there existed strange relations, quite explicable, however: Pyotr Petrovich hated and despised him beyond measure, almost from the day he came to him for hospitality; with that, he seemed to fear him a little.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3045">On arriving at Petersburg, Luzhin had first and foremost stayed with Lebeziatnikoff out of economy, but also for another reason. In his province, he had heard of Andrei Semenovich, his former pupil, as one of the most advanced young progressives in the capital and even as a man occupying a prominent place in certain circles that had passed into legend. This circumstance struck Pyotr Petrovich. For a long time he had felt a vague fear of these powerful circles that knew everything, respected no one, and made war on everyone.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3046">It is needless to add that his distance from Petersburg prevented him from having a very clear view of things in this respect. Like others, he had heard that there were progressives, nihilists, redressers of wrongs, etc., etc., in Petersburg; but in his mind, as in the minds of most people, these words had acquired a meaning exaggerated to the point of absurdity. What he particularly feared were the investigations directed against this or that individual by the revolutionary party. Certain memories which went back to the early days of his career contributed not a little to strengthen in him this fear, which had become very acute since he had begun to cherish the dream of settling in Petersburg.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3047">Two persons of rather high rank who had protected his early career had been attacked by the radicals, and had come to a bad end. That was why, on arriving in the capital, Peter Petrovich was anxious to find out which way the wind was blowing, and, if need be, to win the good graces of "our young generation." He counted on Andrei Semenovich to help him. The conversation of Luzhin, during his visit to Raskolnikov, showed us that he had already succeeded in partly appropriating the language of the reformers.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3048">André Semenovitch was employed in a ministry. Small, sickly, scrofulous, he had almost white blond hair and sideburns of which he was very proud. In addition, he almost always had sore eyes. Although quite a good man at heart, he showed in his speech a presumption often pushed to the point of insolence, which contrasted ridiculously with his puny exterior.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3049">He passed, moreover, for one of the most respectable tenants in the house, because he did not get drunk and paid his rent regularly. With the exception of these merits, André Séménovitch was, in reality, rather stupid. An unreflecting impulse had led him to enlist under the banner of progress. He was one of those innumerable fools who are carried away by the fashionable idea and discredit by their folly a cause to which they are sometimes very sincerely attached.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3050">Besides, in spite of his good nature, Lebeziatnikov had come to find his host and former guardian, Pyotr Petrovitch, unbearable. The antipathy was mutual. In spite of his simplicity, Andrei Semenovitch had begun to realize that Pyotr Petrovitch despised him in his heart and that "there was nothing to be done with that man." He had tried to explain Fourier's system and Darwin's theory to him, but Pyotr Petrovitch, who had at first listened to him with a smile of mockery, had ended by saying rude things to his young catechist. The fact was that Luzhin had finally come to suspect Lebeziatnikov of being not only an idiot, but a braggart who had no importance in his own party. His special function was to be a<i class="calibre4">propaganda</i>, and even then he must not have been very well-versed in it, because he often floundered in his explanations; decidedly, what was there to fear from such an individual?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3051">Let us note in passing that, since his installation with André Séménovitch (especially in the early days), Pierre Pétrovitch accepted with pleasure or at least without protest the very strange compliments of his host: when the latter, for example, lent him great zeal for the establishment of a new<i class="calibre4">common</i>in the Rue des Bourgeois, when he said to him, "You are too intelligent to care if your wife takes a lover a month after your marriage; an enlightened man like you will not have his children baptized," etc., etc., Pierre Petrovitch did not blink an eye when he heard himself praised in this way, so much did he like praise, no matter what it was.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3052">He had negotiated some securities in the morning, and now, sitting at the table, he was counting the sum he had just received. Andrei Semenovich, who almost never had any money, was walking around the room, affecting to regard these bundles of banknotes with contemptuous indifference. Naturally, Pyotr Petrovich did not believe at all that this disdain was sincere. On his side, Lebeziatnikov guessed, not without chagrin, the skeptical thought of Luzhin, and he said to himself that the latter was perhaps very glad to display his money before him in order to humiliate him and remind him of the distance that fortune had put between them.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3053">This time, Pierre Petrovitch was more ill-tempered and inattentive than ever, although Lebeziatnikoff developed his favorite theme: the establishment of a new "commune" of a special kind. The businessman interrupted his accounts only to make a mocking and impolite remark from time to time. But Andrei Semenovich did not care. In his eyes, Luzhin's bad mood was explained by the disappointment of a lover who had been turned away. He was also eager to broach this subject of conversation, having to express on this subject some progressive views that could console his respectable friend and, in any case, contribute to his further development.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3054">"It seems that they are preparing a funeral dinner at that… at the widow's?" asked Loujine abruptly, interrupting Andrei Semenovitch at the most interesting point in his story.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3055">— As if you didn't know! I spoke to you about it yesterday, and I told you my opinion of all these ceremonies… She invited you too, I heard. You yourself spoke to her yesterday…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3056">I should never have believed that, in the poverty she is in, that idiot would go and spend all the money she received from that other idiot... Raskolnikov, on a dinner. Just now, when I came in, I was even amazed to see all these preparations, all these wines!... She has invited several people, the devil knows what it is! continued Pyotr Petrovich, who seemed to have intentionally put the conversation on this subject.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3057">"What? You say she invited me too?" he added suddenly, raising his head. "When was that? I don't remember. I won't go, anyway. What would I do there? I only know her from having spoken to her for a minute yesterday; I told her that, as the widow of an employee, she could obtain temporary assistance. Is that why she invited me? Ha! ha!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3058">“I have no intention of going there either,” said Lebeziatnikoff.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3059">“That's all that was missing! You beat her with your own hands. It's understandable that you had scruples about going to dinner at her house.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3060">"Whom have I beaten? Whom do you mean?" said Lebiezniakoff, confused and blushing.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3061">— I am speaking of Catherine Ivanovna, whom you beat a month ago! I learned of it yesterday… There they are with their convictions!… That is their way of solving the woman question! Ha! ha! ha!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3062">After this outburst, which seemed to have relieved his heart a little, Pierre Petrovitch began to count his money again.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3063">"It's a stupid lie and slander!" Lébéziatnikoff replied quickly, who did not like to be reminded of this story, things did not happen at all like that! What you have been told is false. In the circumstance to which you refer, I limited myself to defending myself. It was Catherine Ivanovna herself, who first threw herself on me to scratch me ... She pulled out one of my favorites ... Every man, I think, has the right to defend his personality. Besides, I am an enemy of violence, wherever it comes from, and that by principle, because it is almost despotism. What should I have done then? Should I have let her brutalize me at her leisure? I just pushed her away.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3064">"He! he! he!" continued to chuckle Luzhin.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3065">“You are picking a quarrel with me because you are in a bad humor, but that means nothing and has nothing to do with the question of women. I even reasoned thus: If it is admitted that woman is the equal of man in everything, even in strength (which is already beginning to be maintained), then equality must exist here too. Of course I reflected afterwards that there was really no need to raise the question, for there cannot be any violence in the future society where the occasions for quarrels will be impossible… consequently, it is absurd to seek equality in the struggle. I am not so stupid… though, by the way, there are quarrels… that is, there will be none later, but for the time being there are still… Oh, devil! it's hard to talk to you! It's not that affair that prevents me from accepting Catherine Ivanovna's invitation. If I don't go to her dinner, it is simply from principle, not to sanction by my presence the idiotic custom of funeral dinners, that's why! Besides, I could go to it just to make fun of it… Unfortunately there will be no priests; if there had been, I should certainly have gone.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3066">“That is to say, you would go and sit at his table to spit on it and on his hospitality, isn't that so?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3067">"Not to spit, but to protest, and for a useful purpose. I can indirectly help the civilizing propaganda that is the duty of every man. Perhaps this task is fulfilled all the better when one puts less form into it. I can sow the idea, the seed... From this seed a fact will be born. Is it hurting people to act like this? At first, they are offended, but then they themselves understand that they have been served...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3068">"Well, all right," interrupted Pyotr Petrovich, "but tell me, do you know the deceased's daughter, that little thin girl... is it true what they say about her, eh?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3069">“Well, what? In my opinion, that is, according to my personal conviction, her situation is the normal situation of women. Why not? That is, let us distinguish. In the present society, of course, this kind of life is not entirely normal, because it is forced; but in the future society it will be absolutely normal, because it will be free. Even now she had the right to do it: she was unhappy; why shouldn't she have freely disposed of what is her capital? Of course, in the future society, capital will have no reason to exist, but the role of the courtesan will take on a different meaning and will be regulated in a rational way. As for Sophie Semyonovna, in the present time, I regard her actions as an energetic protest against the organization of society, and I deeply esteem her for that; I will say more, I contemplate her with happiness!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3070">“Yet, I was told that you had him thrown out of this house!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3071">Lebeziatnikoff was annoyed.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3072">"That's another lie!" he retorted forcefully.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3073">“It was not at all like that! Catherine Ivanovna has told the whole story in the most inaccurate way, because she did not understand it at all! I never sought the favors of Sophie Semyonovna! I simply and purely developed her, without any personal ulterior motive, trying to awaken in her the spirit of protest… I wanted nothing else; she herself felt that she could no longer remain here!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3074">“Did you invite her to join the commune?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3075">“Yes, now I am trying to attract her to the commune. Only, she will be in quite different conditions there than here! Why are you laughing? We want to found our commune on broader bases than the previous ones. We go further than our predecessors, we deny more things! If Dobrolyubov and Belinsky came out of the grave, they would have me as an opponent! In the meantime, I continue to develop Sophia Semyonovna. She is a beautiful, very beautiful nature!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3076">— And you are taking advantage of this beautiful nature? Ha, ha!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3077">— No, no, not at all! On the contrary!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3078">"On the contrary!" he said. Ha! ha! ha!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3079">— You can believe me: for what reasons, I ask you, would I hide from you? On the contrary, there is even one thing that surprises me: with me she seems embarrassed, she has a kind of fearful modesty!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3080">— And, of course, you develop it… he! he! You prove to her that all these pruderies are idiotic?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3081">"Not at all! Not at all! Oh, what a coarse, even stupid meaning — forgive me — you give to the word: development! Oh my God, how you are still ... little advanced! You don't understand anything! We seek the freedom of women, and you only think of trifles ... Leaving aside the question of female chastity and modesty, things in themselves unnecessary and even absurd, I perfectly admit her reserve towards me, since in this she only uses her freedom, exercise her right. Certainly, if she herself said to me: "I want you," I would be very happy, because this young girl pleases me very much; but in the present state of things no one, no doubt, has ever shown himself more polite and more proper with her than me; no one has ever done more justice to her merit ... I wait and hope — that's all!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3082">— Give her a little present instead. I bet you haven't thought of that yet.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3083">“You don't understand anything, I've already told you! Her situation may seem to justify your sarcasm, but the question is quite different! You have nothing but contempt for her. Basing yourself on a fact that seems to you wrongly dishonorable, you refuse to consider a human creature with humanity. You don't know yet what nature it is!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3084">"Tell me," he went on, "can you... or, to put it better, are you sufficiently intimate with the young lady in question to ask her to come here for a minute? They must all have come back from the cemetery... I think I heard them coming up the stairs. I should like to see that person for a moment."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3085">"But why?" asked Andrei Semenovitch in astonishment.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3086">"I must speak to him. I must leave here today or tomorrow, and I have something to communicate to him. Besides, you can be present at our interview, and it will be better so. Otherwise, God knows what you would think."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3087">"I should think nothing of it at all. I asked you the question without attaching any importance to it. If you have business with her, there is nothing easier than to have her come. I will go and fetch her at once, and, be sure of it, I shall not be in your way."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3088">Five minutes later, Lebeziatnikoff returned with Sonya. She was extremely surprised and confused. In such circumstances she was always very timid, and new faces terrified her. This was a childhood impression, and age had increased her wildness. Pyotr Petrovitch was polite and affable. Receiving, as a serious and respectable man, such a young and, in a certain sense, interesting creature, he felt he must greet her with a touch of playful familiarity. He hastened to "reassure" her and invited her to sit down opposite him. Sonya sat down; she looked first at Lebeziatnikoff and then at the money on the table; then suddenly her eyes turned to Pyotr Petrovitch, and they could not leave him; it seemed as though she were under a kind of spell. Lebeziatnikoff went to the door. Luzhin rose, made Sonya sit down again, and stopped Andrey Semyonovitch, who was just going out.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3089">"Is Raskolnikov here? Has he come?" he asked in a low voice.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3090">— Raskolnikoff? Yes. Well, what? Yes, he is there… He just arrived, I saw him… Well?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3091">"In that case, I beg you to stay here and not leave me alone with this... young lady. The matter in question is insignificant, but God knows what conjectures would be made. I don't want Raskolnikov to go around telling<i class="calibre4">there</i>… Do you understand why I am telling you this?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3092">"Ah, I understand, I understand!" replied Lebeziatnikoff. "Yes, you are in your right. Of course, in my personal opinion, your fears are greatly exaggerated, but... never mind, you are in your right. Well, I shall stay. I shall sit by the window and not disturb you. In my opinion, it is your right."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3093">Pyotr Petrovich returned to his seat opposite Sonia and looked at her attentively. Then his face suddenly took on a very serious, almost severe expression: "You too, mademoiselle, do not go imagining things that are not there," he seemed to say. Sonia finally lost her composure.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3094">"First of all, excuse me, please, Sophie Semyonovna, with your very honorable mother... I am not mistaken in expressing myself in this way? Catherine Ivanovna takes the place of a mother to you?" began Pyotr Petrovich in a very serious tone, but, otherwise, quite amiable. Evidently, he had the most friendly intentions.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3095">"Yes, indeed, yes, she takes the place of a mother to me," the poor girl hastened to answer.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3096">— Well, please tell him how much I regret that circumstances beyond my control prevent me from accepting his gracious invitation.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3097">"Yes, I will tell him at once." And Sonetchka rose at once.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3098">"That is not all," continued Pierre Petrovitch, smiling at the young girl's simplicity and ignorance of the usages of society; "you do not know me very well, my dear Sophie Semenovna, if you think that I would have taken the liberty of disturbing a person like you for so futile a reason, which concerns me alone. I have another object in view."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3099">At a gesture from her interlocutor, Sonia had hastened to sit down again. The multi-colored banknotes on the table again presented themselves to her view, but she quickly averted her eyes and raised them to Pyotr Petrovich: it seemed to her extremely improper to look at someone else's money, especially in her position. She looked at the gold-rimmed lorgnette that Pyotr Petrovich held in his left hand, and then at the large ring with a yellow stone that glittered on the middle finger of that hand. Finally, not knowing where to put her eyes, she fixed them on Luzhin's face. The latter, after a majestic silence of a few moments, continued:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3100">— Yesterday, I happened to exchange a few words, in passing, with the unfortunate Catherine Ivanovna. That was enough for me to learn that she is in a state — unnatural, — if one may so express it…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3101">"Yes… unnatural," Sonia repeated obediently.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3102">— Or, to speak more simply and intelligibly — sickly.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3103">— Yes, more simply and more intel… yes, she is ill.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3104">“Yes. Then, out of a feeling of humanity and… and… and, so to speak, compassion, I would like, on my part, to be useful to her, foreseeing that she will inevitably find herself in a very sad position. At present, it seems, the whole of this poor family has no one but you to support it.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3105">Sonia rose suddenly.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3106">— Allow me to ask you if you didn't tell her that she could receive a pension. Yesterday, she told me that you had taken it upon yourself to get her one. Is that true?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3107">"Not at all, and even, in a sense, it is absurd. I have limited myself to making her understand that, as the widow of an official who died in service, she could obtain a temporary relief, if, however, she had protections. But it appears that, far from having served long enough to have created rights to a pension, your late father was not even in service when he died. In a word, one can always hope, but the hope is very little founded, for, in the case, there is no right to relief, on the contrary ... Ah! she already dreamed of a pension, he! he! he! she is a lady who doubts nothing!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3108">"Yes, she was dreaming of a pension. She is credulous and good, her goodness makes her believe everything, and... and... her mind is... Yes... excuse her," said Sonia, who rose again to go.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3109">“Allow me, you haven't heard everything yet.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3110">“I have not heard everything yet,” stammered the girl.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3111">— Well, sit down then.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3112">Sonia, completely confused, sat down for the third time.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3113">“Seeing her in such a situation, with young children, I would like, as I have already said, to be useful to her to the extent of my means, understand me well, to the extent of my means, nothing more. One could, for example, organize a subscription in her favor, a lottery… or something similar, as people who want to help either relatives or strangers always do in such cases. It is a possible thing.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3114">"Yes, that is good... For that God will bless you," Sonia stammered, her eyes fixed on Peter Petrovich.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3115">"We could, but... we'll talk about that later... that is, we could start today. We'll see each other tonight, we'll talk and lay the foundations, so to speak. Come to see me here at seven o'clock. I hope Andrei Semyonovich will be kind enough to attend our conference... But... there is one point that must be carefully examined beforehand. That's why I took it upon myself to bother you by asking you to come here. In my opinion, we should not give the money to Catherine Ivanovna in person, and it would even be dangerous to do so; I need no other proof than today's dinner. She has no shoes, her subsistence is not even guaranteed for two days, and she buys Jamaican rum, Madeira, and coffee. I saw it in passing. Tomorrow, the whole family will fall back on you, you will have to provide it with every last piece of bread; it's absurd. So I am of the opinion that the subscription should be organized without the knowledge of the unfortunate widow, and that you alone should have the disposal of the money. What do you think?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3116">"I don't know. She's only like this today... it only happens once in a lifetime... she wanted very much to honor the memory of the deceased... but she is very intelligent. Besides, it will be as you wish, I will be very, very... they will all be... and God will... and the orphans..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3117">Sonia could not finish and burst into tears.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3118">— So, it's an understood thing. Now please accept this sum for your relative, which represents my personal subscription. I very much desire that my name not be mentioned on this occasion. Here… having myself, in a way, financial difficulties, I regret that I cannot do more…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3119">And Pyotr Petrovich handed Sonia a ten-rouble note, after carefully unfolding it. The girl took the bill, blushing, stammered some unintelligible words, and hurried to take her leave. Pyotr Petrovich escorted her to the door. At last she left the room and returned to Katerina Ivanovna, in a state of extraordinary agitation.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3120">During this scene, André Séménovitch, not wanting to disturb the conversation, had remained near the window or walked around the room. As soon as Sonia was gone, he approached Pierre Pétrovitch and extended his hand with a solemn gesture:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3121">I heard and saw everything, he said, laying emphasis on the last word.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3122">"That is noble, that is human, I mean, for I do not admit the word noble. You wanted to escape thanks, I saw it! And although, to tell the truth, I am, in principle, an enemy of private charity which, far from radically eradicating poverty, promotes its progress, I cannot help but recognize that I saw your act with pleasure, yes, yes, that pleases me.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3123">"Oh, that's the least of it!" muttered Luzhin, a little embarrassed, and he looked at Lebeziatnikov with particular attention.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3124">“No, it is not a small thing! A man who, as embittered as you are by a recent affront, is still capable of taking an interest in the misfortune of others, — such a man may act contrary to sound social economy, but he is no less worthy of esteem! I did not even expect that from you, Pierre Petrovitch, all the more so since, given your way of thinking… Oh! how you are still entangled in your ideas! How you are troubled, in particular, by this business of yesterday!” exclaimed the good Andrei Semenovich, who felt a return of lively sympathy for Pierre Petrovitch, and what need, in truth, do you have to get married, to get married<i class="calibre4">legally</i>, very noble, very dear Pierre Petrovitch? What do you care about the union<i class="calibre4">legal</i>? Beat me if you like, but I rejoice in your failure, I am glad to think that you are free, that you are not yet quite lost to humanity ... You see, I am frank!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3125">"I am for legal marriage because I do not want to wear horns, nor to bring up children who are not mine, as happens with your free marriage," said Pierre Petrovitch, for the sake of saying something. He was thoughtful and paid only a distracted attention to his companion's words.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3126">Children? You have referred to children? repeated Andrei Semenovich, suddenly becoming animated like a war horse that has heard the sound of the trumpet:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3127">— Children are a social question to be settled later. Many even deny them without restriction, as they do everything that concerns the family. We will talk about children later, now let's talk about horns! I admit that this is my weakness. This word, low and vulgar, put into circulation by Pushkin, will not figure in the dictionary of the future. What are horns, in short? Oh! the vain scarecrow! Oh! how insignificant it is! On the contrary, in free marriage, precisely, the danger you fear will not exist. Horns are only the natural consequence and, so to speak, the corrective of legal marriage, a protest against an indissoluble bond; viewed from this point of view, they are not even humiliating… And if ever, an absurd thing to suppose, I contracted a legal marriage, I would be delighted to wear these horns of which you are so afraid; I would then say to my wife: “Until now, my dear, I had only love for you; now I esteem you because you knew how to protest!” You laugh? it is because you do not have the strength to break with prejudices! The devil take me! I understand that, in a legitimate union, it is unpleasant to be cheated, but this is the miserable effect of a situation that degrades both spouses equally. When the horns stand openly on your forehead, as in free marriage, then they no longer exist, they cease to have meaning and even to bear the name of horns. On the contrary, your wife proves to you by this that she esteems you, since she believes you incapable of hindering her happiness, and too enlightened to want to take revenge on a rival. Really, I sometimes think that if I were married (freely or legitimately, it doesn't matter), and that my wife hesitated to take a lover, I would provide her with one myself. “My dear,” I would say to her, “I love you, but I care most of all that you esteem me, that's it!” Am I not right?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3128">These words scarcely made Pierre Petrovitch laugh; his thoughts were elsewhere, and he rubbed his hands with a troubled air. Andrei Semenovitch remembered later his friend's preoccupation...</p>
