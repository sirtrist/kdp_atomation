<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4185">Siberia. On the bank of a wide, deserted river stands a town, one of the administrative centers of Russia; in the town there is a fortress, in the fortress a prison. In the prison Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov has been held for nine months, sentenced to hard labor (second category). Nearly eighteen months have passed since the day he committed his crime.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4186">The investigation of his case encountered few difficulties. The guilty man repeated his confession with as much force as clarity and precision, without confusing the circumstances, without softening the horror, without palliating the facts, without forgetting the slightest detail. He gave a complete account of the murder: he clarified the mystery of the pledge found in the old woman's hands (it will be remembered that it was a piece of wood joined to a piece of iron); he told how he had taken the keys from the victim's pocket, he described these keys, he described the chest and indicated its contents; he explained the murder of Elizabeth, which had remained a mystery until then; he told how Koch had come and knocked on the door, how after him an student had arrived; he reported point by point the conversation that had taken place between these two men: then he, the assassin, had rushed up the stairs, he had heard the cries of Mikolka and Mitka, had hidden in the empty apartment, then had returned to his home. Finally, as for the stolen objects, he said that he had buried them under a stone in a courtyard overlooking the Ascension perspective: they were indeed found there. In short, light was shed on all points. What, among other things, surprised the investigators and judges a lot was that instead of taking advantage of the spoils of his victim, the assassin went to hide them under a stone; they understood even less that not only did he not remember exactly all the objects stolen by him, but that he even made a mistake about their number. It was especially incredible that he had not opened the purse once and that he did not know its contents. (It contained three hundred and seventeen rubles and three twenty-kopeck pieces; as a result of the long stay under the stone, the largest bills that were placed on top of the others had been considerably damaged.) For a long time they tried to guess why on this one point the accused was lying, while on everything else he had spontaneously told the truth. In the end, some (especially among psychologists) admired as possible that he had indeed not visited the purse, and that he had therefore gotten rid of it without knowing what it contained; but they immediately drew the conclusion that the crime itself had necessarily been committed under the influence of a momentary madness: the guilty man, they said, gave in to the sickly monomania of murder and theft, without any ulterior motive, without any interested calculation. This was the opportunity or never to put forward the modern theory of temporary alienation, a theory with which one so often tries today to explain the acts of certain criminals. Besides, the hypochondriac affection from which Raskolnikoff suffered was attested by numerous witnesses: Dr. Zosimoff, the accused's former comrades, his landlady, the servants. All this strongly suggested that Raskolnikoff was not quite an ordinary assassin, a vulgar scoundrel, but that there was something else in his case. To the great dismay of the supporters of this opinion, the guilty man himself did not try to defend himself much; questioned about the motives that could have pushed him to murder and theft, he declared with a brutal frankness that he had been led there by poverty: he hoped, he said, to find at least three thousand rubles at his victim's, and he counted on this sum to secure his beginnings in life; his light and low character, embittered by privations and setbacks, had made him an assassin. When asked why he had gone to denounce himself, he replied bluntly that he had played the comedy of repentance. All this was almost cynical...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4187">The sentence, however, was less severe than might have been expected, considering the crime committed; perhaps the accused was given credit for the fact that, far from trying to exonerate himself, he had rather applied himself to incriminating himself. All the strange peculiarities of the case were taken into consideration. The state of illness and distress in which the criminal found himself before the crime was committed could not be doubted. As he had not profited from the stolen objects, it was supposed that either remorse had prevented him, or that his intellectual faculties were not absolutely intact when he had committed his crime. The murder, which was not premeditated, of Elizabeth even provided an argument in support of this last conjecture: a man commits two murders, and at the same time he forgets that the door is open! Finally, he had gone to denounce himself, and this at the moment when the false confessions of a fanatical and deranged mind (Nicolas) had completely perverted the investigation, when justice was a hundred miles away from suspecting the real culprit (Porphyry Petrovitch kept his word religiously): all these circumstances contributed to temper the severity of the verdict.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4188">On the other hand, the trial suddenly brought to light several facts which were all to the credit of the accused. Documents produced by the former student Razoumikhine established that, while at the University, Raskolnikoff had, for six months, shared his scanty resources with a poor comrade who was suffering from consumption; the latter had died, leaving in poverty an infirm father, whose sole support he had been since the age of thirteen; Raskolnikoff had placed the old man in a sanatorium, and later had paid for his funeral. The testimony of the widow Zarnitzine was also very favourable to the accused. She deposed that, at the time when she lived in the Five Corners with her lodger, a fire having broken out at night in a house, Raskolnikoff had, at the risk of his life, saved two little children from the flames; he had even been severely burned in performing this act of courage. An inquiry was made into this fact, and numerous witnesses certified to its accuracy. In short, the court, taking into consideration the accused's confession as well as his good antecedents, sentenced him only to eight years' penal servitude (second class).</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4189">As soon as the trial opened, Raskolnikov's mother fell ill. Dounia and Razumihin managed to get her away from St. Petersburg for the duration of the trial. Razumihin chose a town that was served by the railway and was not far from the capital; in these conditions, he could attend the hearings assiduously and see Avdotia Romanovna quite often. Pulcheria Alexandrovna's illness was a rather strange nervous condition, with at least partial disturbance of her mental faculties. Returning home after her last meeting with her brother, Dounia found her mother very ill, in the grip of fever and delirium. That same evening, she agreed with Razumihin on the answers to give when Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked about Rodion: they invented a whole story, as if Raskolnikov had been sent far away, to the end of Russia, with a mission that was to bring him much honor and profit. But, to their great surprise, neither then nor later did the old woman question them about this. She herself, in fact, had come up with a novel to explain her son's sudden disappearance: she recounted tearfully the farewell visit he had paid her; on this occasion she hinted that she alone knew several mysterious and very serious circumstances: Rodion was obliged to hide because he had very powerful enemies; moreover, she did not doubt that his future would be very brilliant, as soon as certain difficulties were overcome; she assured Razumihin that in time her son would become a statesman, and she had proof of this in the article he had written, which showed such remarkable literary talent. She read this article constantly, sometimes even aloud, one could almost say that she slept with it, and yet she did not ask much about where Rodia was now, although the very care that was taken to avoid this subject of conversation could already have seemed suspicious to her. The strange silence of Pulcheria Alexandrovna on certain points eventually worried Avdotia Romanovna and Razumihin. Thus she did not even complain that her son did not write to her, whereas in the past, in her little town, she always waited with extreme impatience for letters from her beloved Rodia. This last circumstance was so inexplicable that Dounia was alarmed. The idea came to the young girl that her mother had a presentiment of a terrible misfortune that had befallen Rodia, and that she did not dare to question him for fear of learning something even worse. In any case, Dounia saw very well that Pulcheria Alexandrovna had a deranged mind.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4190">Twice, however, she herself led the conversation in such a way that it was impossible to answer her without indicating where Rodya was at present. As a result of the necessarily vague and embarrassed answers she received, she fell into a deep sadness; for a long time she was gloomy and taciturn as she had never been before. Dounia finally realized that lies and invented stories were counterproductive, and that it was best to keep silent on certain points; but it became increasingly evident to her that Pulcheria Alexandrovna suspected something terrible. Dounia knew in particular - her brother had told her - that her mother had heard her talking in her sleep the night after her meeting with Svidrigailov: had not the words that escaped the young girl's delirium shed a sinister light in the mind of the poor woman? Often, sometimes after days, even weeks of gloomy silence and silent tears, a kind of hysterical exaltation would occur in the sick woman, she would suddenly begin to talk aloud, almost without stopping, about her son, her hopes, the future ... Her imaginations were sometimes very strange. They pretended to agree with her (perhaps she was not fooled by this assent). Nevertheless she did not stop talking ...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4191">The sentence was pronounced five months after the criminal's confession to Ilya Petrovich. As soon as it was possible, Razumikhin went to see the convict in prison, and Sonia visited him too. The time of separation finally came; Dounia swore to her brother that this separation would not be eternal. Razumikhin spoke the same language. The ardent young man had a firmly fixed plan in his mind: they would amass some money for three or four years, then they would go to Siberia, a country where so many riches are waiting to be exploited only by capital and labor; there they would settle in the city where Rodia would be, and ... they would start a new life together. They all cried as they said goodbye. For a few days Raskolnikov had been very worried, he multiplied the questions about his mother, he was constantly worried about her. This excessive concern for her brother was painful to Dounia. When he had been informed in more detail about Pulcheria Alexandrovna's illness, he became extremely gloomy. With Sonia he was always very taciturn. Armed with the money that Svidrigailov had given her, the young girl had long since decided to accompany the convoy of prisoners of which Raskolnikov would be a part. Never a word had been exchanged between her and him on this subject, but they both knew that it would be so. At the moment of the last farewells, the convict had a strange smile on his face when he heard his sister and Razumikhin speak in warm terms of the prosperous future that would open up for them after his release from prison; he foresaw that his mother's illness would not take long to lead her to the grave. Finally, Raskolnikov and Sonia left.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4192">Two months later, Dounia married Razumihin. It was a quiet and sad wedding. Among the guests were Porfiry Petrovich and Zosimov. For some time now, everything had indicated in Razumihin a man who had made an energetic decision. Dounia blindly believed that he would carry out all his plans, and she could not help but believe it, because one could see in him an iron will. He began by returning to the University in order to finish his studies. The two spouses were constantly making plans for the future, they both had the firm intention of emigrating to Siberia within five years. In the meantime, they were counting on Sonia to replace them there...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4193">Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave her consent to her daughter's marriage with Razumihin with great joy; but after the wedding she seemed to become even more anxious and depressed. In order to give her a little pleasure, Razumihin told her about Raskolnikov's noble conduct towards the student and his old father; he also told her how, the year before, Rodya had risked his life to save two little children who were about to perish in a fire. These stories excited Pulcheria Alexandrovna's already troubled mind to the highest degree. She talked of nothing but this, and even in the street she told the passers-by about it (although Dunia always accompanied her). In public carriages, in shops, wherever she met a willing listener, she would turn the conversation to her son, his article, his kindness to the student, his heroic devotion in the fire, etc. Dunia did not know how to stop her. This morbid excitement was not without danger: besides exhausting the poor woman's strength, it might very well happen that someone, hearing Raskolnikov's name, would begin to talk about the trial. Pulcheria Alexandrovna even obtained the address of the woman whose children had been saved by her son, and insisted on going to see her. At last her agitation reached the highest pitch. Sometimes she would suddenly burst into tears, and often she had fits of fever during which she talked wildly. One morning she declared positively that, according to her calculations, Rodya must soon be coming back, for when he came to say goodbye to her he had told her that he would return in nine months. She began to prepare for his coming, and to make his room ready, dusting the furniture, washing the floor, and changing the curtains. Dunia was distressed, but she said nothing and even helped her mother in these preparations. After a whole day of delirious visions, joyful dreams, and tears, Pulcheria Alexandrovna was taken ill with a high fever. She died within a fortnight. Several words uttered by the sick woman during her delirium gave the impression that she had almost guessed the terrible secret which those around her had tried to hide from her.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4194">Raskolnikoff did not know for a long time of his mother's death, although since his arrival in Siberia he had regularly received news of his family through Sonia. Every month the young girl sent a letter to Razumihin's address, and every month she received a reply from Petersburg. At first Sonia's letters seemed to Dounia and Razumihin somewhat dry and insufficient; but later both of them understood that it was impossible to write better ones, since in sum they contained the most complete and precise information about the situation of their unfortunate brother. Sonia described in a very simple and clear way Raskolnikoff's entire existence in prison. She did not speak of her own hopes, nor of her conjectures about the future, nor of her personal feelings. Instead of trying to explain the moral state, the inner life of the condemned man, she limited herself to citing facts, that is, the very words he had spoken; she gave detailed news of his health, she said what desires he had expressed to her, what questions he had asked her, what commissions he had charged her with during their meetings, etc.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4195">But these reports, however detailed they were, were not very comforting, especially in the early days. Dounia and her husband learned from Sonia's correspondence that their brother was always gloomy and taciturn: when the girl told him the news from Petersburg, he hardly paid attention to it; sometimes he asked about his mother, and when Sonia, seeing that he guessed the truth, finally announced the death of Pulcheria Alexandrovna to him, she had noticed, to her great surprise, that he had remained almost impassive. "Although he seems completely absorbed in himself and as if a stranger to everything around him," Sonia wrote among other things, "he looks very frankly at his new life, he understands his situation very well, does not expect anything better for a long time, does not indulge in any frivolous hopes and experiences almost no surprise in this new environment that differs so much from the old one ... his health is satisfactory. He goes to work without reluctance and without haste. He is almost indifferent to food, but, except on Sundays and holidays, this food is so bad that in the end he agreed to accept some money from me to get tea every day. As for the rest, he asks me not to worry about it, because, he assures me, it is unpleasant for him to be taken care of. " "In prison," read another letter, "he is housed with the other prisoners; I have not visited the inside of the fortress, but I have reason to think that it is very bad, very cramped and in unsanitary conditions. He sleeps on a camp bed covered with a felt rug, he wants nothing else. If he refuses everything that could make his material existence less harsh and less coarse, it is not at all by principle, by virtue of a preconceived idea, but simply by apathy, by indifference. " Sonia admitted that, especially at the beginning, her visits, far from pleasing Raskolnikov, caused him a kind of irritation: he only came out of his silence to say rudeness to the girl. Later, it is true, these meetings had become a habit for him, almost a need, to the point that he had been very sad when a few days of indisposition had forced Sonia to interrupt her visits. On holidays, they met either at the prison gate or at the guardhouse where the prisoner was sent for a few minutes when she called him; in ordinary times, she went to find him at work, in the workshops, in the brickworks, in the sheds built on the banks of the Irtysh. As for herself, Sonia said that she had managed to create relationships in her new residence, that she was engaged in sewing, and that, since the city had almost no dressmaker, she had already made herself a fairly nice clientele. What she did not say was that she had called on Raskolnikov the interest of the authorities, that thanks to her he was exempted from the most arduous work, etc. Finally, Razumikhin and Dounia received notice that Raskolnikov was fleeing everyone, that his fellow prisoners did not like him, that he remained silent for days on end and became very pale. Dounia had already noticed a certain anxiety in Sonia's last letters. Suddenly she wrote that the convict had fallen seriously ill, and that he had been admitted to the prison hospital ...</p>
