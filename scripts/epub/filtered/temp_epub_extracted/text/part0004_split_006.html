<h2 class="calibre7" id="h220">VI</h2>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2184">"I don't believe it! I can't believe it!" repeated Razumihin, who was making every effort to reject Raskolnikov's conclusions. They were already near the Bakaleyev house, where Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Dounia had been waiting for them for a long time. In the heat of the discussion, Razumihin stopped every moment in the middle of the street; he was very agitated, for it was the first time that the two young men had spoken of this otherwise than in veiled hints.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2185">Don't believe it, if you like," replied Raskolnikov with a cold and indifferent smile.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2186">— You, as usual, noticed nothing, but I weighed every word.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2187">"You are inclined to be suspicious, and that is why you see hidden motives everywhere. Hum... I admit that Porphyry's tone was rather strange, and especially that rascal Zametov... You are right, there was something about him... but how is it possible, how?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2188">— He must have changed his mind since yesterday.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2189">“No, you are wrong! If they had such a stupid idea, they would, on the contrary, have taken care to conceal it; they would have hidden their game to inspire you with a fallacious confidence, waiting for the moment to unmask their batteries… In the hypothesis in which you place yourself, their way of acting today would be as clumsy as brazen!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2190">"If they had facts, I mean serious facts, or even some well-founded suspicions, then they would certainly try to hide their game in the hope of gaining new advantages over me (besides, they would have searched my house long ago). But they have no evidence, not a single one; everything for them is reduced to gratuitous conjectures, to suppositions that are not supported by anything real, that is why they resort to impudence. Perhaps we should see in this only the disappointment of Porphyry, who is enraged at not having any evidence. Perhaps he also has his intentions ... He seems intelligent ... It is possible that he wanted to frighten me ... He has his own psychology, my friend ... Besides, all these questions are repulsive to clarify. Let's leave it!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2191">“It's loathsome, loathsome! I understand you! But… since we've broached this subject frankly (and I think we've done well), I won't hesitate to tell you that I've noticed this idea in them for a long time. Of course, it barely dared to formulate itself, it floated in their minds in the form of a vague doubt, but it's already too much that they could have accepted it even in this form!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2192">And what aroused such abominable suspicions? If you knew how furious it made me! What! Here is a poor student struggling with poverty and hypochondria, on the verge of a serious illness that may already exist in him; here is a defiant young man, full of self-esteem, aware of his worth, for six months locked up in his room where he sees no one; he appears dressed in rags, shod in boots without soles, before miserable policemen whose insolence he suffers; he is asked point-blank to pay a protested bill of exchange; the room is crowded, it is thirty degrees Réaumur, the smell of oil paint completes the unbearable atmosphere; the unfortunate man hears about the murder of a person he visited the day before, and he has an empty stomach! But, in such conditions, how could one not faint! And it is on this syncope that everything rests! That is the starting point of the accusation! To hell with them! I understand that it is vexing; but in your place, Rodia, I would laugh in their faces, or better: I would send my contempt in their faces in the form of jets of saliva; that's how I would end it with them. Courage! Spit on it! It's shameful!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2193">"He delivered his tirade with conviction, though!" thought Raskolnikov.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2194">Spit on it? That's easy to say; but tomorrow there's another interrogation!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2195">— he replied sadly; will I have to stoop so low as to give them explanations! I already regret having agreed to talk with Zametov yesterday at the traktir…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2196">"The devil take them! I'll go to Porphyry myself! He's my kinsman, and I'll take advantage of it to worm the truth out of him; he must make a full confession to me! And as for Zametov..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2197">"At last the fish has been hooked!" thought Raskolnikov.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2198">"Wait!" cried Razumihin, suddenly seizing his friend by the shoulder, "wait! You were raving just now! I'm convinced, after all, that you were raving! Where do you see a trick? You say that the question about the painters was a trap? Just think a little: if you had done that, would you have been so stupid as to say that you had seen the painters working in the second flat? On the contrary: even if you had seen them, you would have denied it! Who makes admissions that are meant to compromise him?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2199">— If I had done<i class="calibre4">this thing</i>"If I had seen them, I should not have failed to mention it," said Raskolnikov, who seemed to be continuing the conversation with great reluctance.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2200">— But why then say things that are harmful to his cause?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2201">"Because only peasants and the most stupid people deny everything out of prejudice. A defendant who is even slightly intelligent admits as many material facts as possible, the reality of which he would try in vain to destroy; only he explains them in a different way, he modifies their meaning, he presents them in a new light. According to all probability, Porphyre expected me to answer in this way; he believed that, to give more credibility to my statements, I would admit to having seen the workers, except to explain the fact later in a sense favorable to my cause.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2202">“But he would have answered you at once that the day before the crime the workmen had not been there, and that, consequently, you had been in the house on the very day of the murder, between seven and eight o'clock. You would have been caught!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2203">— He counted on my not having time to reflect, and that, pressed to answer in the most plausible manner, I would forget this circumstance; the impossibility of the presence of the workers in the house the day before the crime.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2204">— But how can I forget that?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2205">“Nothing could be easier! These details are the snare of the clever; it is by answering them that they trip themselves up in the course of an examination. The more a man is clever, the less he suspects the danger of insignificant questions. Porphyre knows that well; he is far from being as stupid as you think...”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2206">— If that is so, he is a scoundrel!...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2207">Raskolnikov could not help laughing. But at the same time he was surprised at having given the last explanation with such genuine pleasure, he who, up to that time, had carried on the conversation only reluctantly and because the aim to be attained made it a necessity.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2208">"Would I take a liking to these questions?" he thought.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2209">But almost at the same time he was seized with a sudden uneasiness that soon became intolerable. The two young men were already at the door of the Bakaléieff house.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2210">"Come in alone," said Raskolnikov suddenly, "I will come back immediately."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2211">“Where are you going? We're here!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2212">— I have an errand to run... I'll be back in half an hour... You tell them...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2213">“Well, I'll go with you!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2214">— Ah, you too, have you sworn to persecute me to death?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2215">This exclamation was uttered with such an accent of fury and with such a desperate air that Razumihin did not dare to insist. He remained for some time on the porch, following with a gloomy look Raskolnikov, who walked with long strides in the direction of his _pereoulok_. Finally, after grinding his teeth, clenching his fists, and promising himself to squeeze Porphyry like a lemon that very day, he went up to the ladies to reassure Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who was already anxious at his long absence.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2216">When Raskolnikov reached his lodgings, his temples were wet with sweat and he was breathing heavily. He ran up the stairs four at a time, entered his room, which was still open, and immediately locked himself in with the hook. Then, in a panic, he ran to his hiding place, put his hand under the wallpaper, and explored the hole in every direction. Not finding anything, after feeling in all the nooks and crannies, he stood up and sighed with relief. At one point, as he approached the Bakaleyeff house, the idea suddenly came to him that one of the stolen objects might have slipped into a crack in the wall: if one day they were to find a watch chain, a cufflink, or even one of the papers that wrapped the jewels and had annotations written by the old woman's hand, what a terrible piece of evidence it would be against him!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2217">He remained as if plunged in a vague reverie, and a strange, almost dazed smile hovered on his lips. At last he took his cap and quietly left the room. His thoughts were in a whirl. Pensive, he descended the stairs and arrived under the carriage entrance.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2218">"There he is!" cried a loud voice.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2219">The young man raised his head.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2220">The dvornik, standing on the threshold of his lodge, was pointing Raskolnikov out to a man of small stature and bourgeois appearance. This individual was wearing a sort of caftan and a waistcoat; from a distance, one would have taken him for a peasant. His head, covered by a greasy cap, was bent on his chest, and he seemed all hunched over. To judge by his wrinkled and withered face, he must have been over fifty. His small eyes had something hard and discontented about them.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2221">"What is it?" asked Raskolnikov, approaching the dvornik.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2222">The bourgeois looked at him sideways, examined him at length, then, without uttering a word, turned his back and walked away from the house.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2223">"But what is it?" cried Raskolnikov.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2224">— Well, it was a man who came to inquire if a student was not living here; he named you and asked where you were staying. During that time, you came down, I showed you and he left: that's it!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2225">The dvornik was also a little surprised, but not too much. After thinking for a moment, he went back into his lodge.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2226">Raskolnikov rushed after the bourgeois. As soon as he left the house, he saw him walking along the other side of the street; the stranger walked with a slow and regular step, he kept his eyes fixed on the ground and seemed to be pensive. The young man soon caught up with him, but for some time he limited himself to following in his footsteps; in the end, he placed himself beside him and looked obliquely at his face. The bourgeois immediately noticed him, threw him a quick glance, then lowered his eyes again. For a minute, they both walked side by side, without saying a word.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2227">"You asked me... at the dvornik's?" Raskolnikov began, without raising his voice.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2228">The bourgeois made no reply, and did not even look at the man who spoke to him. There was another silence.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2229">"You have come... to ask me... and you are silent... What does that mean?" Raskolnikov repeated in a broken voice, as if his words were difficult to utter.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2230">This time the bourgeois raised his eyes and looked at the young man with a sinister air.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2231">"Assassin!" he said suddenly in a low but clear and distinct voice.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2232">Raskolnikov walked beside him. He suddenly felt his legs give way and a chill run down his back; for a second his heart seemed to fail, then began to beat with extraordinary violence. The two men walked thus for a hundred paces side by side without uttering a word.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2233">The bourgeois did not look at his traveling companion.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2234">"But what do you mean... what?... who is a murderer?" Raskolnikov stammered in a nearly inaudible voice.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2235">"You are the murderer," he said, emphasizing the words with more energy and distinctness than ever; and at the same time he seemed to have a smile of triumph on his lips, and he looked with a piercing gaze at Raskolnikov's pale face, whose eyes had become dim.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2236">They were now approaching a cross-road. The gentleman turned to the left and went on his way without looking back. Raskolnikov let him go, but followed him with his eyes for a long time. After going fifty paces, the stranger turned round to look at the young man, who was still standing in the same place. The distance was too great to see clearly, but Raskolnikov thought he noticed that the man was still looking at him with his cold, triumphant smile of hatred.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2237">Shivering with fear, his legs trembling, he somehow managed to get back to his lodgings and went up to his room. After placing his cap on the table, he stood there motionless for ten minutes. Then, exhausted, he lay down on his sofa and stretched out languidly with a faint sigh.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2238">After half an hour, hurried footsteps were heard, and at the same time Raskolnikov perceived Razumihin's voice; he closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep. Razumihin opened the door and, for a few minutes, remained on the threshold, appearing not to know what to decide. Then he entered very softly into the room and cautiously approached the sofa.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2239">"Don't wake him, let him sleep it off, he'll eat later," said Nastasia in a low voice.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2240">"You are right," replied Razumihin.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2241">They tiptoed out and pushed the door to. Another half-hour passed, then Raskolnikov opened his eyes, turned over on his back with a sudden movement, and put his hands behind his head.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2242">"Who is he? What is this man who came out from under the ground? Where was he and what did he see? He saw everything, that is indisputable. Where was he then and from what place did he see this scene? How is it that he did not give any sign of life before? And how could he have seen? Is it possible?... Hm!... continued Raskolnikov, seized with a cold shiver, — and the casket that Nikolay found behind the door: could one have expected that too?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2243">He felt that he was weakening, that his physical strength was abandoning him, and he felt a violent disgust for himself:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2244">"I should have known that," he thought with a bitter smile; "how did I dare, knowing myself, foreseeing what would happen to me, how did I dare take an axe and shed blood? I was bound to know that in advance... and besides, I knew it!" he murmured in despair.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2245">At times he stopped before a thought:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2246">"No, these people are not built that way: the true<i class="calibre4">master</i>, to whom everything is permitted, cannonades Toulon, massacre in Paris,<i class="calibre4">forget</i>he loses a half-million men in the Moscow campaign, and gets out of trouble at Vilna by a pun; after his death, statues are erected to him — it is therefore that<i class="calibre4">everything</i>He is allowed to do so. No, these people are not made of flesh, but of bronze! »</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2247">An idea that suddenly came to his mind almost made him laugh:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2248">"Napoleon, the Pyramids, Waterloo, — and an old woman, the widow of a college registrar, an ignoble usurer who has a red morocco trunk under her bed, — how would Porfiry Petrovich digest such a comparison?... Aesthetics is against it: "Would Napoleon have slipped under the bed of an old woman?" he would say. Oh! what nonsense!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2249">From time to time he felt that he was almost delirious; he was in a state of feverish exaltation.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2250">"The old woman means nothing," he said to himself in fits:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2251">"Let us suppose that the old woman was a mistake, it is not about her! The old woman was only an accident... I wanted to take the plunge as soon as possible... It is not a human being that I killed, it is a principle! I killed the principle, but I did not know how to get over it, I stayed below... I only knew how to kill! And even then I did not do it too well, it seems... A principle? Why did that idiot Razumikhin attack the socialists just now? They are hard-working businessmen; "they are concerned with the common good" ... No, I have only one life, I do not want to wait for "universal happiness". I want to live myself, otherwise it is better not to exist. I do not want to pass by a hungry mother while clutching my rouble in my pocket, on the pretext that one day everyone will be happy. "I bring, they say, my stone to the edifice of universal happiness, and that is enough to put my heart at peace." Ha! ha! Why then have you forgotten me? Since I only have a time to live, I want my share of happiness right away... Eh! I am an aesthetic vermin, nothing more, he added suddenly, laughing like a madman, and he attached himself to this idea, he took a bitter pleasure in digging it up in every way, in turning it over on all sides.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2252">"Yes, I am a vermin," he said, "first of all because I am now pondering the question of whether I am one; secondly, because for a whole month I have been pestering the divine Providence, constantly calling it to witness that I was embarking on this enterprise not for the sake of material gain, but for the sake of a grandiose goal, ha! ha! Thirdly, because in carrying it out I wanted to act with as much justice as possible: among all the vermin I chose the most harmful, and, in killing her, I intended to take from her just what I needed to start my life, no more and no less (the rest would have gone to the monastery to which she had bequeathed her fortune, ha! ha!)... I am definitely a vermin," he added, grinding his teeth, "because I am perhaps even more vile and ignoble than the vermin I killed, and because I<i class="calibre4">felt</i>that after killing her, I would say that! Is there anything comparable to such terror? Oh! platitude! oh! platitude!... Oh! how I understand the Prophet on horseback, with the scimitar in his fist! Allah wants it, obey, "trembling" creature! He is right, he is right, the Prophet, when he lines up a beautiful troop across the street and strikes indiscriminately on the just and the guilty, without even deigning to explain! Obey, trembling creature, and<i class="calibre4">Beware of wishing.</i>, because it is not your business!… Oh! never, never will I forgive the old woman! »</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2253">His hair was soaked with sweat, his dry lips were twitching, and his unmoving gaze was fixed on the ceiling.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2254">"My mother, my sister, how I loved them! Why do I hate them now? Yes, I hate them, I hate them physically, I cannot bear them near me. I remember that just now I went up to my mother and kissed her. To kiss her and to think that if she knew... Oh, how I hate the old woman now! I believe that if she came to life I should kill her again! Poor Elizabeth, why did chance bring her here? It is strange, though, that I think of her so little, as though I had not killed her. Elizabeth! Sonia! Poor, gentle creatures with soft eyes... Dear ones!... Why do they not weep? Why do they not moan?... Resigned victims, they accept everything in silence... Sonia, Sonia! gentle Sonia!..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2255">He lost consciousness of himself, and to his great surprise found himself in the street. It was already late in the evening. The darkness was growing thicker, the full moon shone with a brighter and brighter light, but the air was still stifling. There were many people in the streets; the workmen and the working men were going home, others were strolling about; there was a smell of lime, dust, and stagnant water in the air. Raskolnikov walked along, sad and preoccupied; he remembered very well that he had come out of his room with a purpose, that he had to do something very important, but what it was he had forgotten. Suddenly he stopped and noticed that a man on the other side of the pavement was making signs to him. He crossed the street to him, but the man turned round and, as if he had not seen him, continued walking on with his head down, not looking round, and not seeming to call Raskolnikov. "Have I made a mistake?" thought the latter; however, he followed him. Before he had gone ten paces he recognized him and was seized with terror: it was the gentleman of that morning, still stooping, still wearing the same dressing-gown. Raskolnikov, whose heart was beating violently, walked a little way behind him; they entered a narrow lane.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2256">"The man still did not turn around. "Does he know that I am following him?" Raskolnikov wondered. The bourgeois crossed the threshold of a large house. Raskolnikov quickly approached the door and began to look, thinking that perhaps this mysterious figure would turn around and call him. Indeed, when the bourgeois was in the courtyard, he turned around abruptly and seemed to call the young man with a gesture. He hurried into the house, but when he arrived in the courtyard, he could not find the bourgeois. Assuming that this man had taken the first staircase, Raskolnikov followed him. Indeed, two floors up, one could hear slow and regular steps on the steps. Strange, it seemed to him to recognize this staircase! Here is the window of the first floor; through the glass filtered, mysterious and sad, the light of the moon; here is the second floor. Bah! It is the apartment where the painters worked ... How then had he not recognized the house immediately? The steps of the man who preceded him ceased to be heard: "He has therefore stopped or hidden somewhere. Here is the third floor: shall I go up higher? And what silence! this silence is even frightening ... "Nevertheless he continued to climb the stairs. The sound of his own steps frightened him. "My God, how dark it is! The bourgeois has certainly hidden here in a corner. Ah!" The apartment that gave onto the square was wide open; Raskolnikov thought for a moment, then entered. The anteroom was completely empty and very dark. The young man went into the living room on tiptoe. The light of the moon shone directly on this room and lit it up entirely; the furniture had not changed; Raskolnikov found the chairs, the mirror, the yellow sofa and the framed drawings in their old places. Through the window one could see the moon whose enormous round face was copper red. He waited a long time in the midst of a deep silence. Suddenly he heard a sharp noise like that of a splinter breaking, then everything became silent again. A fly woke up and flew into the window, and began to buzz plaintively. At the same moment, in the corner, between the small cupboard and the window, he thought he noticed a woman's coat hanging on the wall.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2257">— "Why is this coat here?" he thought.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2258">"It wasn't there before..." He approached very cautiously, and suspected that someone must be hiding behind the coat. Carefully pushing the coat aside, he saw that there was a chair there: on this chair, in the corner, was the old woman; she was as if doubled over, and held her head so low that he could not see her face, but it was Alena Ivanovna. "She's afraid!" Raskolnikov thought; he carefully freed his axe from the noose and, twice, struck the old woman on the sinciput. But, strangely, she did not even stagger under the blows, as if she were made of wood. Stunned, the young man leaned towards her to examine her, but she lowered her head even more. He then bent down to the floor, looked at her from bottom to top, and, seeing her face, was terrified: the old woman was laughing, yes, she was laughing with a silent laugh, making every effort not to be heard. Suddenly it seemed to Raskolnikov that the door to the bedroom was open, and that there, too, they were laughing, whispering. Rage seized him: with all his strength he began to strike the old woman's head, but with each blow of the axe, the laughter and whispering from the bedroom became more distinct; as for the old woman, she was writhing. He wanted to run away, but the entire hallway was already full of people, the door to the square was open; on the landing, on the stairs, from top to bottom, there were many people; everyone was looking, but everyone had hidden and was waiting in silence... His heart was pounding, his feet seemed nailed to the floor... he wanted to scream and woke up.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2259">He breathed with effort, but he thought he had not ceased to dream, when he saw, standing on the threshold of his wide-open door, a man he did not know at all and who was looking at him attentively.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2260">Raskolnikov had not yet had time to open his eyes fully when he suddenly closed them again. Lying on his back, he did not move. "Is this the continuation of my dream?" he thought, and he raised his eyelids almost imperceptibly to cast a timid glance at the stranger. The latter, still in the same place, did not cease to observe him. Suddenly, he crossed the threshold, closed the door very softly behind him, approached the table, and, after waiting a minute, sat down noiselessly on a chair near the sofa. During all this time, he had not taken his eyes off Raskolnikov. Then he put his hat on the floor beside him, rested both hands on the knob of his cane, and let his chin fall on his hands like someone who is preparing to wait a long time. As far as Raskolnikov could judge by a furtive glance, this man was no longer young; he had a robust appearance and wore a thick, almost white blond beard...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2261">Ten minutes passed in this way. It was still light, but it was getting late. The room was perfectly still. There was no sound even from the stairs. Only the buzzing of a big fly could be heard, which had flown against the window. At last it became unbearable. Raskolnikov could not stand it any longer, and suddenly sat down on his sofa.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2262">— Come, speak; what do you want?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2263">"I knew that your sleep was a sham," said the stranger with a quiet smile.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2264">— Allow me to introduce myself: Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigailov...</p>
