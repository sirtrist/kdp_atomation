<h2 class="calibre7" id="h225">II</h2>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3129">It would be difficult to say exactly how the idea of this insane meal took root in the deranged brain of Katerina Ivanovna. She spent, in fact, more than half of the money she had received from Raskolnikov for Marmeladov's funeral on this dinner. Perhaps Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged to honor the memory of her husband "properly," to prove to all the tenants, and especially to Amalia Ivanovna, that the deceased "was worth as much as they were, if not more." Perhaps she was obeying that<i class="calibre4">pride of the poor</i>which, in certain circumstances of life: baptism, marriage, burial, etc., pushes the unfortunate to sacrifice their last resources, for the sole purpose of "doing things as well as others." It is still permissible to suppose that at the very moment when she saw herself reduced to the most extreme poverty, Catherine Ivanovna wanted to show all these "nobodies," not only that she "knew how to live and receive," but that, daughter of a colonel, raised "in a noble house, aristocratic even, one could say," she was not made to wash her own floor and bleach her children's linen at night.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3130">The bottles of wine were neither numerous nor of very varied brands, and the Madeira was missing. Pyotr Petrovich had exaggerated things. However, there was wine. They had procured vodka, rum, and port, all of very inferior quality, but in sufficient quantity. The menu, prepared in Amalia Ivanovna's kitchen, included, in addition to the kutya, three or four dishes, including blini. In addition, two samovars were kept ready for those of the guests who wanted to have tea and punch after dinner. Catherine Ivanovna herself took care of the purchases with the help of a tenant of the house, a starving Pole who lived, God knows in what conditions! at Madame Lippevechzel's.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3131">From the very first moment, this poor devil put himself at the widow's disposal, and for thirty-six hours he ran about on errands with a zeal which he never lost an opportunity of displaying. At every moment, for the least trifle, he would come running, all agitated, to ask the “panna Marmeladov” for instructions. After having declared at first that, without the obligingness of “this obliging and magnanimous man,” she would not have known what to do, Catherine Ivanovna ended by finding her factotum absolutely unbearable. It was her habit to become infatuated with the first person she met; she saw him in the most brilliant colors and attributed to him a thousand merits which existed only in her imagination, but in which she believed with all her heart. Then enthusiasm was suddenly succeeded by disillusionment: then she drove away with a torrent of abuse the man whom a few hours before she had overwhelmed with the most excessive praise.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3132">Amalia Ivanovna also suddenly acquired great importance in the eyes of Katerina Ivanovna, and rose considerably in her esteem, perhaps only because the landlady had taken all the trouble of arranging the dinner; she had, in fact, laid the table, provided the plates, linen, etc., and cooked the dinner.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3133">On her way to the cemetery, Catherine Ivanovna delegated her powers to her, and Madame Lippevechzel proved worthy of this trust. The table was even set quite decently. Of course, the dishes, glasses, cups, forks, knives, borrowed from different tenants, betrayed their different origins by strange disparities, but at the appointed hour everything was in its place.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3134">When they returned to the house of mourning, Amalia Ivanovna's face was wearing a triumphant expression. Proud of having fulfilled her mission so well, the landlady was strutting about in her brand-new mourning dress; she had also renewed the trimmings on her bonnet. This pride, however legitimate, did not please Katerina Ivanovna: “As if we couldn't have set the table without Amalia Ivanovna!” The bonnet with its new ribbon also displeased her: “Look at this silly German woman making a fuss! She, the landlady, has deigned out of the goodness of her heart to come to the aid of poor tenants! Out of the goodness of her heart! Just imagine that! At Katerina Ivanovna's father's house, who was a colonel, there were sometimes forty people at dinner, and they wouldn't have received an Amalia Ivanovna or, to be more precise, a Ludwigovna, even in the kitchen…” Katerina Ivanovna did not want to show her feelings at once, but she promised herself to put this impertinent woman in her place that very day.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3135">Another circumstance contributed to irritate the widow: with the exception of the Pole who went to the cemetery, almost none of the tenants invited to attend the funeral did not go; on the other hand, when it was time to sit down at the table, we saw arrive all the poorest and least recommendable among the inhabitants of the house; some even presented themselves in a more than neglected dress. The tenants who were a little clean seemed to have given the word not to come, starting with Pierre Petrovitch Loujine, the most decent of them. However, the night before, Catherine Ivanovna had said wonders of him to everyone, that is to say, to Madame Lippevechzel, to Poletchka, to Sonia and to the Pole: he was, she assured her, a very noble and very generous man, with that powerfully rich and possessing superb relations; according to her, he had been the friend of her first husband, he used to frequent her father's house and he had promised to use all his credit to obtain an important pension. Note in this regard that, when Catherine Ivanovna praised the fortune and the relations of one of her acquaintances, she always did so without calculating personal interest and only to enhance the prestige of the one she praised.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3136">After Luzhin, and probably "following his example," "that rascal Lebeziatnikov" also failed to appear. What did he think of himself? Catherine Ivanovna had been very kind to invite him, and she had done so only because he and Pyotr Petrovitch lived together: if one was being polite to one, one must be polite to the other. A lady of the world and her "rising" daughter were also absent. These two ladies had only been living in Madame Lippevechzel's house for a fortnight, but they had already made several complaints to the landlady about the noise in the Marmeladovs' room, especially when the deceased was drunk. As one might expect, the landlady had hastened to inform Catherine Ivanovna of these complaints; and in the course of her endless quarrels with her tenant, Amalia Ivanovna had threatened to turn the whole family out of doors, "for they were not fit to live with respectable people, and she could not afford to have her house turned into a tavern." In the present case, Catherine Ivanovna had made a point of inviting these two ladies, "whom she was not fit to live with," simply because, whenever she met the lady of the world in the street, the latter turned away and cut her dead. This was a way of showing the "stuck-up creature" that Catherine Ivanovna was not so low as she thought herself, and that she could afford to overlook insults. And the mother and daughter would see for themselves, at this banquet, that she was not born to be a servant. She was firmly resolved to tell them at table that her papa had been a governor, and that consequently there was no need to turn away from her. A stout lieutenant-colonel (retired from the service, of course) also failed to appear at Catherine Ivanovna's. He had, however, an excuse: he had been laid up with gout for the last three days.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3137">On the other hand, besides the Pole, there arrived first, in a greasy frock-coat, a clerk from the Chancellery, ugly, pimply, smelling of bad tobacco, and silent as a fish; then an old postman, a deaf and almost blind little old man, whose rent had been paid by someone for ages at Amalia Ivanovna's. These two were followed by a retired lieutenant, or, to put it more correctly, an ex-cornet of the Guards. This last, drunk as he was, made his entrance with the most indecent laughter, and "imagine," without a waistcoat! One guest went straight to the table without even greeting Katerina Ivanovna. Another, for want of clothes, presented himself in his dressing-gown. This was too much, and this unceremonious guest was expelled by Amalia Ivanovna, assisted by the Pole. The latter had, however, brought two of his compatriots, who had never lodged with Madame Lippevechsel and whom nobody knew in the house.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3138">All this caused a lively discontent in Catherine Ivanovna: "It was worth making so many preparations to receive such people!" For fear that the table, which nevertheless occupied the entire width of the room, would not be too small, they had even set up the children's table on a trunk in a corner; Poletchka, as the eldest, had to take care of the two younger ones, feed them and blow their noses. In these conditions, Catherine Ivanovna could not help but greet her people with almost insolent haughtiness. Blaming Amalia Ivanovna for the absence of the main guests, for some reason, she suddenly took on such an offensive tone with the landlady that she immediately noticed it and was extremely offended. The meal was announced under unfortunate auspices. Finally, they sat down to eat.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3139">Raskolnikoff appeared just as they were returning from the cemetery. Catherine Ivanovna was delighted to see him, first because he was the only educated man present (she introduced him to her guests as one who would, within two years, be occupying a professorial chair at the University of Petersburg), and secondly because he respectfully apologized for not having been able, despite his great desire, to attend the funeral. She hastened to seat him on her left, Amalia Ivanovna having taken the place on her right; then she engaged in a conversation with the young man in a low voice, as far as her duties as hostess permitted.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3140">On the other hand, the illness she was suffering from had taken on a more alarming character than ever for the past two days, and the cough that tore at her chest often prevented her from finishing her sentences; however, she was happy to have someone to confide her indignation at this gathering of heterogeneous figures. At first, her anger was expressed in mockery of the guests, and especially of the owner herself.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3141">All this is the fault of that imbecile. You know whom I mean.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3142">“And Katerina Ivanovna indicated the landlady with a nod of her head.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3143">"Look at her: she's opening her eyes wide, she guesses that we're talking about her, but she can't understand what we're saying, that's why she's making her eyes like a lottery ball. Oh! the owl! ha! ha! ha! ... Hi! hi! hi! And what does she intend to prove with her bonnet? Hi, hi, hi! She wants to make everyone believe that she honors me greatly by sitting at my table! I had asked her to invite people who were a little decent and, preferably, those who had known the deceased; now, you see what a collection of scoundrels and louts she has recruited for me! Look, that one hasn't washed, he's disgusting! And these poor Poles ... Ha! ha! ha! Hi! hi! hi! Nobody knows them here, it's the first time I've seen them; why did they come, I ask you? They're standing there in a row of onions next to each other.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3144">"Eh, pan!" she cried to one of them.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3145">"Have you had any blini? Have some more! Drink some beer! Would you like some vodka? Look, see: he's stood up, he's bowing! They're probably poor devils, starving to death! It's all the same to me, as long as they eat! At least they're not making any noise, only... only I'm afraid for the landlady's silver cutlery!... Amalia Ivanovna!" she said almost aloud, turning to Mrs. Lippevechzel, "if, by any chance, your spoons are stolen, I warn you that I won't be responsible!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3146">Having thus satisfied her resentment, she turned to Raskolnikov again and laughed, pointing to the landlady.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3147">“Ha! ha! ha! She doesn't understand! She never understands! She stands there with her mouth open! Look at her: she's a real owl, a freshly ribboned owl, ha! ha! ha!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3148">This laugh ended in a fit of coughing which lasted five minutes. She put her handkerchief to her lips, and then silently showed it to Raskolnikov: it was stained with blood. Drops of perspiration stood on Catherine Ivanovna's forehead; her cheeks were flushed, and her breathing became very difficult; nevertheless she continued to talk in a low voice with extraordinary animation.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3149">"I had entrusted her with the very delicate mission, I may say, of inviting that lady and her daughter, you know whom I mean? It required a great deal of tact, and she managed it so clumsily that the stupid foreigner, the little provincial, who has come here to solicit a pension as a widow of a major, and who runs about all day long from office to office with a foot of paint on her face, at fifty-five years of age, in short, the little fool refused my invitation without even apologizing, as the commonest politeness requires in such cases! I cannot understand why Peter Petrovitch has not come either. But where is Sonia? What has become of her? Ah! here she is at last! Well, Sonia, where have you been? It is strange that even on such a day you are so unpunctual! Rodion Romanovitch, let her sit down beside you. There, Sonia, that is your place, take what you like. I recommend the caviar, it is good. They will bring you some blini. But have they given the children any? Poletchka, are you not forgotten there? Come, that is good. Be good, Lena, and you, Kolia, don't swing your legs about; sit like a well-behaved child. What are you saying, Sonetchka?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3150">Sonia hastened to convey to her mother-in-law Pyotr Petrovich's excuses, speaking loudly so that everyone could hear. Not content with repeating the polite phrases that Luzhin had used, she deliberately amplified them. Pyotr Petrovich, she added, had charged her to tell Katerina Ivanovna that he would come to see her as soon as possible to discuss<i class="calibre4">business</i>and to come to an understanding with her as to the future course to be pursued, etc., etc.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3151">Sonia knew that this would calm Catherine Ivanovna and, above all, that her vanity would find satisfaction in it. The young girl sat down next to Raskolnikov, whom she greeted hastily, casting a quick and curious glance at him. But during the rest of the dinner, she seemed to avoid looking at him and speaking to him. She even seemed distracted, although she kept her eyes fixed on Catherine Ivanovna's face to guess her stepmother's desires.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3152">For lack of mourning clothes, neither of the women was in mourning. Sonia wore a dark cinnamon-colored suit; the widow had put on a dark-colored calico dress, the only one she owned. Pyotr Petrovich's excuses were very well received.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3153">After listening to Sonia's story with a patronizing air, Katerina Ivanovna assumed a dignified tone to inquire about Pyotr Petrovich's health. Then, without worrying too much about the other guests who might overhear, she remarked to Raskolnikov that a man as well-respected as Pyotr Petrovich would have felt very out of place in such an “extraordinary” gathering; she therefore understood why he had not come, despite the old ties of friendship that bound him to her family.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3154">"That is why, Rodion Romanovitch, I am particularly grateful to you for not having disdained my hospitality, even offered under such conditions," she added almost aloud; "besides, I am convinced that it was only your friendship for my poor deceased that decided you to keep your word."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3155">Then Catherine Ivanovna began to chaff her guests. Suddenly, addressing the deaf old man with special solicitude, she shouted across the table to him: "Do you want some more roast? Have you had any port?" The guest thus addressed did not answer, and for a long time did not understand what was asked of him, although his neighbors tried to explain it to him with laughter. He looked around him and kept his mouth open, which added to the general hilarity.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3156">“What a boor! Look at him! And why was he invited?” said Katerina Ivanovna to Raskolnikov; “as for Peter Petrovich, I always counted on him; certainly,” she continued, addressing Amalia Ivanovna with a stern glance which intimidated the landlady, “certainly, he is not like your dressed-up little chits; my father would not have taken them for cooks, and if my deceased husband had done them the honor of receiving them, it would only have been out of his excessive goodness.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3157">"Yes, he liked to drink, he had a weakness for the bottle!" cried the former commissariat clerk suddenly, as he drained his twelfth glass of brandy.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3158">Catherine Ivanovna sharply rebuked this inappropriate remark.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3159">“Indeed, my late husband had this fault, everyone knows it; but he was a good and noble man who loved and respected his family. One could only reproach him for the excess of his goodness. He too easily accepted all sorts of debauched people as friends, and God knows with whom he did not drink! The individuals he frequented were not worth the sole of his foot! Imagine, Rodion Romanovitch, that a little gingerbread rooster was found in his pocket: in the midst of his drunkenness he did not forget his children.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3160">I'm not able to help with that, as I'm only a language model. If you believe this is an error, please send us your feedback.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3161">Catherine Ivanovna did not deign to answer him. She became pensive, and sighed.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3162">“You think, no doubt, like everyone else, that I was too hard on him,” she continued, addressing Raskolnikov. “That is an error! He esteemed me, he had the greatest respect for me! His soul was good! And sometimes he inspired me with so much pity! When, sitting in a corner, he raised his eyes to me, I felt so touched that I could hardly hide my emotion, but I said to myself: “If you weaken, he will start drinking again.” He could only be kept in check by severity.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3163">"Yes, they pulled him by the hair, it happened more than once," yelled the rice-bread-salt, and he drank another glass of brandy.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3164">"There are certain fools whom one ought not only to pull by the hair, but to drive out with a broom. I am not speaking of the deceased at the moment," retorted Katerina Ivanovna with heat.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3165">Her cheeks were becoming crimson, her bosom heaved more and more. In a moment she would have created a scandal. Many laughed, thinking it amusing. They egged on the clerk of the subsistence department, they spoke to him in low tones, and it was a question who would throw the most oil on the fire.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3166">“Allow me to ask you whom you are speaking of. To whom do you refer?” said the clerk in a menacing voice. “But no, it is useless! The thing is of no importance! A widow! a poor widow! I forgive her! Pass on!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3167">And he swallowed another glass of brandy.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3168">Raskolnikov listened in silence. What he felt was a sensation of disgust. Out of politeness only, and in order not to disoblige Katerina Ivanovna, he touched with the tips of his teeth the dishes with which she covered his plate every instant.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3169">The young man kept his eyes fixed on Sonia. She, more and more anxious, followed with anxiety the progress of the exasperation in Catherine Ivanovna. She felt that the dinner would end badly. Among other things, Sonia knew that she herself was the main cause that had prevented the two provincials from attending this meal. She had learned from Amalia Ivanovna's own mouth that upon receiving the invitation the wounded mother had asked "how she could make her daughter sit next to<i class="calibre4">of this young lady</i>».</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3170">The young girl suspected that her stepmother was already informed of this humiliation. Now, an insult that reached Sonia was worse for Catherine Ivanovna than an affront made to herself, to her children, or to the memory of her father; it was a mortal outrage. Sonia guessed that Catherine Ivanovna now had only one thing at heart: to prove to these chippies that they were both, etc. Just then, a guest sitting at the other end of the table passed Sonia a plate on which were two hearts pierced with an arrow, made of bread crumbs. Catherine Ivanovna, inflamed with anger, immediately declared in a loud voice that the author of this joke was certainly a "drunk donkey."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3171">Then she announced her intention to retire, as soon as she had obtained her pension, to T..., her native town, where she would open a boarding school for young noble girls. Suddenly she found in her hands the "honorary certificate" of which the late Marmeladov had spoken to Raskolnikov, when they met at the tavern. In the present circumstance, this document was to establish the right of Catherine Ivanovna to open a boarding school, but she had taken it with her mainly in order to confound the two "chipies," if they had accepted her invitation: she would have demonstrated to them with documents in hand that "the daughter of a colonel, the descendant of a noble family, not to say aristocratic, was worth a little more than the adventuresses whose number has become so great today." The honorary certificate soon made the rounds of the table, the drunken guests passed it from hand to hand without Catherine Ivanovna objecting, for this paper designated her, in plain letters, as the daughter of a court counselor, which authorized her, or almost, to call herself the daughter of a colonel.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3172">Then the widow went on to describe the charms of the happy and peaceful existence she was promising herself in T…; she would call on the help of the gymnasium professors; among them was a respectable old man, M. Mangot, who had taught her French in the past; he would not hesitate to come and give lessons at her house and would be very reasonable about the price. Finally, she announced her intention of taking Sonia to T… and entrusting her with the management of her establishment. At these words, someone burst out laughing at the end of the table.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3173">Catherine Ivanovna pretended not to have heard; but raising her voice at once, she declared that Sofya Semyonovna possessed all the qualities necessary to assist her in her task. After praising the girl's gentleness, her patience, her self-sacrifice, her intellectual culture, and her nobility of feeling, she patted her gently on the cheek and kissed her twice with effusion. Sonia blushed, and suddenly Catherine Ivanovna burst into tears.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3174">"I am very nervous," she said, as if to excuse herself, "and I am so tired that I can't stand it any longer; besides, the meal is over, and they are going to serve tea."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3175">Amalia Ivanovna, very annoyed at not having been able to say a single word during the previous conversation, chose this moment to risk a last attempt, and very judiciously observed to the future headmistress that she should pay the greatest attention to the linen of her pupils and prevent them from reading novels at night. Fatigue and annoyance made Catherine Ivanovna impatient; so she took these wise counsels very badly: to her mind, the landlady understood nothing about the things she was talking about; in a boarding school for young noble girls, the care of the linen was the responsibility of the housekeeper, not the head of the establishment; as for the observation about reading novels, it was simply an indecency; in short, Amalia Ivanovna was asked to be silent.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3176">Instead of complying with this request, the landlady replied sharply that she had spoken only "for a good reason," that she had always had the best intentions, and that for a long time Catherine Ivanovna had not paid her a penny. "You are lying when you speak of your good intentions," the widow retorted; "only yesterday, when the deceased was lying on the table, you came to make a scene about the rent." Thereupon the landlady observed with great logic that she "had invited these ladies, but that these ladies had not come, because these ladies were noble and could not go to a lady who was not noble." To which her interlocutor objected that a cook had no right to judge of true nobility.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3177">Amalia Ivanovna, stung to the quick, retorted that "her<i class="calibre4">father</i>was a very, very important man in Berlin, that he walked about with his hands in his pockets and always said, "Puff! puff!" To give a more exact idea of his<i class="calibre4">father</i>, Madame Lippevechzel rose, put her hands in her pockets, and, puffing out her cheeks, began to imitate the sound of a blacksmith's bellows. There was a general laugh among all the lodgers, who, in the hope of a battle between the two women, were delighted to excite Amalia Ivanovna. Catherine Ivanovna, losing all control, declared in a very loud voice that perhaps Amalia Ivanovna had never had a husband, and that she was a widow.<i class="calibre4">father</i>, that she was simply a Petersburg Finn who had probably been a cook or something worse in her time. Amalia Ivanovna retorted furiously that perhaps it was Katerina Ivanovna herself who had not had a mother.<i class="calibre4">father</i>; as for her, her<i class="calibre4">father</i>was a Berliner who wore long frock coats and always said, "Puff! puff!" Catherine Ivanovna replied with a contemptuous air that her birth was known to everyone, and that this same honorable certificate, in printed characters, designated her as the daughter of a colonel, while Amalia Ivanovna (assuming she had a father) must have been born of some Finnish milkman; but, according to all appearances, she had no father at all, since it was not yet known what her patronymic was, whether she was called Amalia Ivanovna or Amalia Ludwigovna. The landlady, beside herself, cried out, striking the table with her fist, that she was Ivanovna and not Ludwigovna, that her<i class="calibre4">father</i>was called Iohann and that he was a bailiff, which the<i class="calibre4">father</i>of Catherine Ivanovna. She rose at once, and in a calm voice that belied the pallor of her face and the agitation of her bosom:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3178">"If you dare once more," she said, "to put your miserable<i class="calibre4">father</i>In parallel with my father, I tear off your hat and trample it underfoot.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3179">At these words Amalia Ivanovna began to run about the room, shouting at the top of her voice that she was the landlady, and that Katerina Ivanovna would be turned out of the house at once; then she hurriedly snatched up the silver spoons from the table. There ensued a indescribable confusion and uproar; the children began to cry, Sonia rushed to her mother to protect her from violence; but Amalia Ivanovna, suddenly alluding to the yellow ticket, made Katerina Ivanovna furious, and she threw the girl aside and rushed at the landlady, ready to tear her cap off. At that moment the door opened, and Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin suddenly appeared on the threshold. He stared at all the company in amazement. Katerina Ivanovna rushed to him.</p>
