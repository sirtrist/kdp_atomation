<h2 class="calibre7" id="h217">III</h2>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1764">"He is better, he is better!" cried Zossimov gaily, as he saw the two women enter. The doctor had been there for ten minutes, and was sitting on the sofa in the same place as the day before. Raskolnikov, sitting at the other end, was fully dressed; he had even taken the trouble to shave and brush his hair, which he had not done for some time. Although the arrival of Razumihin and the two ladies had filled the room, Nastasia managed to slip in behind them, and she remained to listen to the conversation.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1765">Raskolnikov was indeed feeling better, especially compared to the day before, but he was very pale and immersed in a gloomy reverie.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1766">When Pulcheria Alexandrovna entered with her daughter, Zosimov noticed with surprise the expression on the patient's face. It was not joy, but a sort of resigned stoicism; the young man seemed to be summoning up his energy to endure for an hour or two a torture from which there was no escape. After the conversation began, the doctor observed that almost every word seemed to reopen a wound in his client's soul; but at the same time he was surprised to see him relatively in control of himself: the furious monomaniac of the previous day now knew how to control himself to a certain extent and conceal his impressions.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1767">"Yes, I see for myself now that I am almost cured," said Raskolnikov, kissing his mother and sister with a cordiality that brought a radiant joy to Pulcheria Alexandrovna's face, "and I do not say this as I did yesterday," he added, turning to Razumihin, whose hand he squeezed affectionately.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1768">"I was even surprised to find him so well today," Zosimoff began. "In three or four days, if this continues, he will be quite as he was before, that is, as he was a month or two ago... or perhaps three. For this illness had been brewing for a long time, hadn't it? Admit now that perhaps you had something to do with it?" the doctor concluded with a restrained smile, still seeming to fear irritating his client.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1769">"It is quite possible," answered Raskolnikov coldly.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1770">"Now that we can talk to you," Zosimoff continued, "I would like to convince you that it is necessary to eliminate the primary causes that have led to the development of your illness. If you do this, you will recover; otherwise, the illness will only get worse. I do not know these primary causes, but you must know them. You are an intelligent man, and you have probably observed yourself. It seems to me that your health began to deteriorate after you left the university. You cannot remain idle; it would therefore be very useful, in my opinion, for you to get to work, to set a goal for yourself and to pursue it with tenacity.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1771">— Yes, yes, you are perfectly right… I will go back to the University as soon as possible, and then everything will go… like clockwork…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1772">The doctor had given his wise advice in part to produce an effect before the ladies. When he had finished, he glanced at his client and was probably somewhat disappointed to see that his face expressed only frank mockery. However, Zosimoff was soon consoled for his disappointment. Pulcheria Alexandrovna hastened to thank him and expressed her particular gratitude for the visit he had made to the two ladies the night before.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1773">"He came to your place last night?" Raskolnikov asked in an anxious voice.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1774">"So you have not even rested after such a tiring journey?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1775">"Oh, Rodya, it was not yet two o'clock. Dounia and I never go to bed before that."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1776">"I don't know how to thank him either," continued Raskolnikov, who suddenly frowned and lowered his head. Leaving aside the question of money," he said to Zosimov, "I don't even know what could have earned me such interest from you. I don't understand it... and... I would even say that this benevolence weighs on me, because it is incomprehensible to me: you see that I am frank."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1777">“Do not worry about it,” said Zosimoff, affecting to laugh; “suppose that you are my first client! Now, we doctors, when we are starting, love our first patients as if they were our own children; some of us become almost in love with them. And I, you see, have not yet a large clientele.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1778">"I am not speaking of him," said Raskolnikov, pointing to Razumihin, "I have only insulted him and made him feel awkward."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1779">"What nonsense you are talking!" cried Razumihin. "You seem to be in a sentimental mood today!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1780">Had he been more perspicacious, he would have seen that his friend was far from being sentimental, but in a very different frame of mind. But Avdotia Romanovna was not mistaken, and, feeling uneasy, began to watch her brother attentively.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1781">"Of you, mother, I hardly dare speak," Raskolnikov continued, as though he were reciting a lesson he had learned by heart that morning; "only today I have been able to understand how you must have suffered yesterday evening, waiting for my return."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1782">At these words he smiled and suddenly held out his hand to his sister. This gesture was not accompanied by any words, but the smile on the young man's face expressed this time a true feeling; there was no pretense in it. Joyful and grateful, Dounia immediately seized the hand that was held out to her and squeezed it hard. It was the first sign of attention he had given her since their altercation the day before. Pulcheria Alexandrovna, a witness to this silent and final reconciliation between brother and sister, became radiant.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1783">Razumikhin fidgeted in his chair.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1784">I should love him for that alone! he murmured, with his tendency to exaggerate everything.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1785">— There are the sort of movements he makes!…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1786">"And how well he did that!" thought the mother to herself, "what noble impulses he has! This simple act of extending his hand to his sister and looking at her with affection, was it not the most frank and delicate way to put an end to the misunderstanding of the previous evening?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1787">"Ah, Rodya," she said, hastening to reply to her son's observation, "you can't imagine how unhappy Dounia and I were yesterday! Now that it's all over and we are all happy again, I can tell you. Imagine, we had just got out of the train at Petersburg, and we were going to embrace you, and this woman, — here she is, Nastasia! — she suddenly tells us that you had been lying in bed with fever for the last three days, and that you had just run out of the house delirious, and that they were looking for you all over the place. You can't imagine how we felt! We were frightened to death."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1788">"Yes, yes, it is certainly very unpleasant," muttered Raskolnikov, but he made this reply in such a distracted, not to say indifferent, tone that Dounia looked at him in surprise.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1789">What was it I wanted to tell you? he continued, trying to recall his memories:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1790">“Yes, I beg you, mother, and you, Dounia, don't think that I refused to go to see you first today, and that I waited for your prior visit.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1791">“But why do you say that, Rodya?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna exclaimed, this time no less astonished than her daughter.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1792">"He seems to be answering us out of mere politeness," thought Dounia; "he makes peace, he asks pardon, as though he were fulfilling a pure formality or reciting a lesson."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1793">“I wanted to come to you as soon as I woke up, but I had no clothes to wear; I should have told Nastasia yesterday to wash off that blood… I was only able to dress just now.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1794">"Blood! What blood?" asked Pulcheria Alexandrovna in alarm.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1795">"It is nothing... do not worry. Yesterday, while I was delirious, while I was wandering in the street, I ran into a man who had just been run over... an employee; that is how my clothes got bloody..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1796">"During your delirium? But you remember everything!" interrupted Razumihin.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1797">“That is true,” answered Raskolnikov, with a troubled air; “I remember everything, down to the smallest detail, but here is what is strange: I cannot explain to myself why I did this, why I said that, why I went to such a place.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1798">“It is a well-known phenomenon,” observed Zosimoff; “the act is sometimes accomplished with extraordinary skill and dexterity; but the principle from which it emanates is altered in the insane, and depends on various morbid impressions.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1799">The word "insane" fell like a cold drop; Zosimov had let it slip out without thinking, so engrossed was he in the pleasure of declaiming on his favorite theme. Raskolnikov, absorbed in a kind of reverie, seemed to pay no attention to the doctor's words. An odd smile played on his pale lips.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1800">"Well, what about the man who was crushed? I interrupted you just now," Razumikhin hurried to say.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1801">"What?" said Raskolnikov, as if waking up; "yes... well, I got covered in blood helping to carry him home... By the way, mother, I did something unforgivable yesterday; I must have been out of my mind. I gave away all the money you sent me yesterday... to his widow... for the funeral. The poor woman is very much to be pitied... she has tuberculosis... she is left with three small children on her hands, and she has no way to feed them... there is also a daughter... Perhaps you yourself would have done the same as me, if you had seen this misery. Besides, I admit, I had no right to act like this, especially knowing how hard you had to work to get me this money.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1802">"Leave it alone, Rodya, I am convinced that everything you do is very good!" replied the mother.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1803">“Don't be so sure of that,” he replied, with a grimace of a smile.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1804">The conversation was suspended for some time. Words, silence, reconciliation, forgiveness, everything had something forced about it, and everyone felt it.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1805">"Do you know, Rodya, that Marfa Petrovna is dead?" Pulcheria Alexandrovna suddenly asked.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1806">— Which Marfa Petrovna?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1807">“Ah, my God, but Marfa Petrovna Svidrigailov! I spoke to you so long about her in my last letter!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1808">— A-a-ah ! yes, I remember. So she is dead? Ah! indeed, he said with the sudden start of a man who awakes. Is it possible that she is dead? Of what?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1809">“Imagine that she was kidnapped all of a sudden!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna hastened to reply, encouraged to continue by the curiosity her son was showing.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1810">— She died the very day I sent you this letter. It seems that this horrible man was the cause of her death. They say he beat her to death!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1811">"Did such scenes take place in their household?" Raskolnikov asked his sister.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1812">— No, on the contrary, he was always very patient, very polite even with her. In many cases, he showed too much indulgence, and that lasted seven years... His patience escaped him all of a sudden.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1813">"So he wasn't such a terrible man, since he waited seven years! You seem to be excusing him, Dounia?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1814">The young girl frowned.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1815">"Yes, yes, he is a terrible man! I can't imagine anything more horrible," she replied, almost shivering, and she became thoughtful.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1816">“They had this scene together in the morning,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna continued. “After that, she immediately ordered the horses to be harnessed, because she wanted to go to town immediately after dinner, as she usually did on such occasions; at table she ate, they say, with great appetite…”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1817">— All covered with bruises?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1818">— … It was her habit. After dinner, she went to take her bath, so as to be ready to leave sooner… You see, she was being treated with hydrotherapy; there is a spring at their house, and she bathed there regularly every day. She had barely entered the water when she had an attack of apoplexy.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1819">“That's not surprising!” observed Zosimoff.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1820">— And had she been seriously beaten by her husband?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1821">“But what does that matter?” asked Avdotya Romanovna.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1822">"Hm! Besides, mother, I don't see why you are telling such nonsense," said Raskolnikov with sudden irritation.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1823">"But, my friend, I didn't know what to talk about," Pulcheria Alexandrovna admitted naively.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1824">"It seems that you are both afraid of me," he said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1825">"It is true," said Dounia, fixing her eyes sternly on him. "Mother even made the sign of the cross on the stairs, she was so frightened."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1826">The young man's features changed, as if he were seized with convulsions.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1827">“Ah, what are you saying, Dounia? Don't be angry, please, Rodya… How can you talk like that, Dounia?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna excused herself, all confused; “what is true is that in the train I did not stop thinking, during the whole journey, of the happiness of seeing you again and talking to you… I was so happy about it that I did not even notice the length of the journey! And now I am happy, happy to be with you again, Rodya…”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1828">"Enough, mother," he murmured with agitation, and, without looking at his mother, he squeezed her hand, "we have time to talk!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1829">He had scarcely uttered these words when he felt himself confused and pale; again he felt a mortal chill at the bottom of his soul, again he confessed to himself that he had just told a frightful lie, for henceforth he was no longer permitted to speak his mind to his mother, nor to anyone. At the moment, the impression of this cruel thought was so vivid that, forgetting the presence of his hosts, the young man rose and went to the door.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1830">“What are you doing?” cried Razumihin, seizing him by the arm.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1831">Raskolnikov sat down again and silently looked around him. Everyone was staring at him in amazement.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1832">“But how boring you all are!” he suddenly exclaimed. “Say something! Why are you all silent? Speak up! We don't meet to be silent; well, let's talk!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1833">"God be praised!" said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself. "I thought he was going to have another attack like yesterday."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1834">"What is the matter with you, Rodya?" asked Avdotia Romanovna, with an anxious look.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1835">"Nothing," he said, "it was a silly thing that came into my head," and he began to laugh.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1836">"Well, if it is a stupid thing, so much the better! But I myself was afraid," murmured Zosimoff, rising. "I must leave you; I will try to come back during the day."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1837">He bowed and left.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1838">"What a fine man!" observed Pulcheria Alexandrovna.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1839">"Yes, he is a good man, a man of merit, educated, intelligent," said Raskolnikov, who uttered these words with an unusual animation, "I can't remember where I met him before my illness... I think I met him somewhere... Here is another excellent man!" he added, nodding towards Razumihin; "but where are you going?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1840">Razumihin had, in fact, just risen.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1841">"I must go too," he said. "I have business."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1842">"You have nothing to do at all, stay here! It is because Zosimoff has gone that you want to leave us too. Do not go away... But what time is it? Is it noon? What a pretty watch you have, Dounia! Why are you still silent? It is only I who am speaking!..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1843">"It's a present from Marfa Petrovna," said Dounia.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1844">"And it cost a lot," added Pulcheria Alexandrovna.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1845">"I thought that came from Luzhin."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1846">“No, he hasn't given anything to Dounetchka yet.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1847">“Ah! do you remember, mother, that I was in love and wanted to get married?” he said abruptly, looking at his mother, who was struck by the unexpected turn he had given to the conversation and by the tone in which he spoke.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1848">"Ah, yes, my dear," replied Pulcheria Alexandrovna, exchanging a glance with Dounia and Razumihin.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1849">Hum! yes! but what shall I tell you? I hardly remember anything about it. She was a sickly young girl, all suffering, he continued in a dreamy tone, with his eyes downcast.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1850">— She loved to give alms to the poor and always thought of entering a monastery; one day I saw her burst into tears while she was talking to me about it, yes, yes ... I remember ... I remember very well. She was rather ugly than pretty. Really, I don't know why I was attached to her then, perhaps I loved her because she was always sick ... If she had been, in addition, lame or hunchbacked, it seems to me that I would have loved her even more ... (He smiled thoughtfully.) It didn't matter ... it was a spring madness ...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1851">"No, it was not only a spring madness," observed Dounia with conviction. Raskolnikov looked at his sister very attentively, but did not hear or even understand her words. Then, with a melancholy air, he got up, went to kiss his mother, and returned to his seat.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1852">“Do you still love him?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in a trembling voice.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1853">— She? Again? Ah! yes… you are talking about her! No. All that is now far from me… and for a long time. I have, moreover, the same impression for everything that surrounds me…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1854">He looked attentively at the two women.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1855">"Look, you are here, but it seems to me that I see you at a distance of a thousand versts. But the devil knows why we are talking about this! And why ask me?" he added angrily; then silently he began to bite his nails and fell into a reverie.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1856">"What a horrible place you live in, Rodya!" Pulcheria Alexandrovna suddenly exclaimed, breaking a silence that was painful to her; "I am sure this room is half the cause of your hypochondria."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1857">This room? he repeated, with a distracted air.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1858">"Yes, she contributed a great deal… that's what I thought too… If you only knew, mother, what a strange idea you have just expressed!" he added suddenly with an enigmatic smile.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1859">Raskolnikov was scarcely able to bear the presence of his mother and sister, from whom he had been separated for three years, but with whom he felt that all conversation was impossible. However, there was one matter which could not be put off; and when he got up he had made up his mind that it must be settled one way or another that very day. At the moment he was glad to find in this matter a means of escape from his embarrassment.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1860">"Here is what I have to say to you, Dounia," he began in a dry tone, "naturally I apologize for the incident of yesterday, but I believe it is my duty to remind you that I maintain the terms of my dilemma: either me or Luzhin. I may be infamous, but you must not be. That's enough for one. So if you marry Luzhin, I immediately cease to consider you as a sister."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1861">“Rodia! Rodia!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, in distress, “why do you keep saying the same thing over and over again? Why do you keep calling yourself an infamous wretch? I can't bear it!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1862">"My brother," replied Dounia, in a tone which was neither dry nor harsh, but which did not yield to Raskolnikoff's, "the misunderstanding which divides us arises from an error in which you are laboring. I have thought about it all night, and I have discovered in what it consists. You suppose that I am sacrificing myself for someone. Now, that is where you are mistaken. I am marrying simply for myself, because my own situation is difficult. Of course, later on, I shall be glad if I can be of use to my family, but that is not the principal motive of my resolution..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1863">"She is lying!" thought Raskolnikov to himself, gnawing his nails in anger.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1864">“The proud woman! She will not consent to admit that she wants to be my benefactress! What arrogance! Oh! the low characters! Their love resembles hatred… Oh! that I… hate them all!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1865">"In a word," continued Dounia, "I am marrying Pyotr Petrovitch because, of two evils, I choose the less. I intend to fulfil my obligations conscientiously; so I am not deceiving him. Why did you smile just now?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1866">She blushed, and a flash of anger lit up her eyes.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1867">"Will you fill it all?" he asked, smiling bitterly.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1868">“Up to a certain point. From the way Pierre Petrovitch asked for my hand, I saw at once what he wanted. He may have too high an opinion of himself; but I hope he will appreciate me too… Why are you laughing again?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1869">“And why are you blushing again? You are lying, my sister; you cannot esteem Luzhin: I have seen him and talked with him. Therefore, you are marrying for money; you are doing, in any case, a base thing, and I am glad to see that at least you still know how to blush!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1870">"It is not true, I am not lying!" cried the girl, losing all self-control; "I will not marry him unless I am sure that he appreciates and values me; I will not marry him unless I am fully convinced that I can esteem him myself. Fortunately, I have the means of assuring myself of this in a peremptory manner, and, what is more, today itself. This marriage is not a baseness, as you say! But even if you were right, even if I had indeed decided on a baseness, would it not be cruel of you to speak to me like that? Why demand of me a heroism that you may not have yourself? It is tyranny, it is violence! If I do harm to anyone, it will only be to myself... I have not yet killed anyone!... What are you looking at me like that for? Why are you turning pale? Rodia, what is the matter with you? Rodia, dear!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1871">"Lord! he has fainted, and it is you who are the cause of it!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1872">"No, no, it's nothing, a trifle! My head turned a little. I didn't faint at all... Fainting is for you... Hmmm! yes... What was I going to say? Ah! how will you convince yourself today that you can esteem Luzhin and that he... appreciates you, for that is what you said just now, or did I hear wrong?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1873">"Mamma, show my brother the letter from Pierre Petrovitch," said Dounia.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1874">Pulcheria Alexandrovna handed him the letter with a trembling hand. Raskolnikov read it attentively twice. Everyone was expecting some outburst. The mother, especially, was very anxious.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1875">After remaining thoughtful for a moment, the young man returned the letter to her.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1876">“I don't understand it,” he began, without addressing anyone in particular: he pleads, he's an attorney, he even strives for fine language in his conversation, and he writes like an illiterate.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1877">These words caused a general stupefaction; it was not at all what was expected.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1878">"At least he doesn't write very literarily, if his style is not quite that of an illiterate; he wields the pen like a businessman," added Raskolnikov.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1879">"Peter Petrovich, besides, does not conceal that he has received little education, and he prides himself on being the son of his own works," said Avdotia Romanovna, a little piqued by the tone her brother had taken.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1880">"Well, he has reason to be proud, I don't deny it. You seem to be angry, sister, because I made only a frivolous remark about this letter, and you think I am purposely insisting on such trifles to tease you? Far from it; as to the style, I made a remark which, in this case, is far from being without importance. This phrase: 'You will have only yourself to blame,' leaves nothing to be desired in the way of clearness. Moreover, he announces his intention of leaving at once, if I go to you. This threat of leaving amounts to saying that, if you do not obey him, he will leave you both in the lurch, after having brought you to Petersburg. Well, what do you think? Coming from Luzhin, can these words offend as much as they would if they had been written by him (he pointed to Razumihin), by Zosimov, or by one of us?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1881">“No,” answered Dounia, “I understood that he expressed his thought too naïvely, and that perhaps he is not very clever at writing... Your remark is very judicious, brother. I did not even expect...”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1882">— Since he writes like a man of business, he could not express himself otherwise, and it is perhaps not his fault if he has been so coarse. Besides, I must disenchant you a little: in this letter there is another phrase which contains a calumny against me, and a rather vile calumny. I gave money yesterday to a consumptive widow overwhelmed with misfortune, not, as he writes, "under the pretext of paying for the funeral," but for the funeral; and this sum I gave to the widow herself, and not to the daughter of the deceased, — this young girl "of notorious misconduct," he says, whom I saw yesterday for the first time in my life. In all this I discover only the desire to blacken me in your eyes and to estrange me from you. Here again he writes in the legal style, that is to say, he reveals his purpose very clearly and pursues it without any formalities. He is intelligent; but to conduct oneself wisely, intelligence alone is not enough. All this paints the man, and... I do not think he appreciates you very much. This is said for your edification, for I sincerely wish you well.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1883">Dounyasha did not reply; her mind was made up, and she was only waiting for the evening.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1884">"Well, Rodya, what are you going to do?" asked Pulcheria Alexandrovna, whose anxiety had been growing ever since she had heard her son discussing business matters in such a businesslike way.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1885">— What do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1886">“You see what Pierre Petrovich writes: he wants you not to come to our house tonight, and he declares that he will leave… if you come. That is why I ask you what you intend to do.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1887">“I have nothing to decide. It is for you and Dounia to see if this demand of Pyotr Petrovitch has anything offensive for you. I shall do as you please,” he added coldly.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1888">"Dounia has already decided the question, and I am fully of her opinion," Pulcheria Alexandrovna hastened to reply.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1889">“I think it is essential that you should be present at this interview, Rodya, and I beg you to come,” said Dunia. “Will you come?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1890">— Yes.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1891">"I beg you to come to our house at eight o'clock," she continued, addressing Razumihin. "Mother, I invite Dmitri Prokofitch too."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1892">"You are right, Dounia," added Pulcheria Alexandrovna. "Let it be as you wish," she added, with a sigh. "I, too, am relieved. I do not like to deceive and to lie; it is better to have a frank explanation. Let Pierre Petrovitch be angry now, if he likes."</p>
