<h2 class="calibre7" id="h210">III</h2>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p835">However, during the whole time of his illness he was never completely unconscious; he was in a feverish state, with delirium and semi-consciousness. He remembered a great deal afterwards. Sometimes it seemed to him that several people were gathered about him, wanted to take him and carry him somewhere, argued violently and quarrelled about him. Sometimes he suddenly saw himself alone in his room, everybody had gone away, they were afraid of him, only occasionally the door opened and someone peeped in at him from a distance; people threatened him, consulted together, laughed, made him angry. He often saw Nastasia at his bedside; he also noticed a man who must have been very familiar to him, but who was it? He could never put a name to this face, and this distressed him so much that he would weep.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p836">Sometimes he imagined he had been in bed for a month already; at other times, all the incidents of his illness seemed to him to occur in a single day. But<i class="calibre4">that</i>, —<i class="calibre4">this</i>, he had absolutely forgotten it; at every moment, it is true, he said to himself that he had forgotten something he should have remembered, — he tormented himself, made painful efforts of memory, groaned, became furious, or was seized with an unspeakable terror. Then he would rise up in his bed, wanted to run away, but always someone held him back by force. These crises weakened him and ended in fainting. At last he regained the full use of his senses.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p837">It was then ten o'clock in the morning. When the weather was fine, the sun always came into the room at that hour, throwing a long strip of light on the right-hand wall and lighting up the corner near the door. Nastasia was standing in front of the sick man's bed with a person he did not know at all, who was looking at him with great curiosity. It was a young man with a budding beard, dressed in a caftan and looking like an artelchtchik. <span class="superscript-rw"></span> <span class="superscript-rw"> <span class="ref-note-rw" id="rw-ref-note-4"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre3 pcalibre4 pcalibre pcalibre1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0010.html#rw-num-note-4">4</a></span> </span> <span class="superscript-rw"><p class="Standard">The calculation of probabilities is a vain science, and we must be wary of that obscure instinct we called common sense, which we asked to legitimize our conventions.</p></span> Through the half-open door, the landlady was looking in. Raskolnikov raised himself a little.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p838">"Who is this, Nastasia?" he asked, pointing to the young man.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p839">"Look, he's come to himself!" said the maid.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p840">“He has come to himself!” said the artelchik in turn.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p841">At these words, the landlady closed the door and disappeared. Her timidity always made conversations and explanations difficult for her. This woman, aged forty, had black eyes and eyebrows, a pronounced plumpness and, all in all, a very pleasant appearance. Good, as fat and lazy people are, she was also extremely modest.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p842">"Who... are you?" Raskolnikov continued to ask, this time addressing the coachman. But at that moment the door opened again and Razumihin entered, bowing slightly as he came in, because of his great height.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p843">“What a ship's cabin!” he exclaimed, as he entered. “I keep hitting my head against the ceiling; and they call this a lodging! Well, my friend, you have recovered your senses, as Pachenka told me just now?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p844">"He has just come to his senses," said Nastasia.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p845">“He has just come to his senses,” echoed the artelchik with a smile.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p846">But who are you yourself? Razumikhin suddenly asked him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p847">“I am, you see, called Razumihin, I am a student, the son of a gentleman, and this gentleman is my friend. Now, you, tell me who you are.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p848">— I am employed by the merchant Chelopaief, and I am here on business.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p849">"Sit down in this chair," said Razumihin, taking a chair himself and sitting down at the other side of the table.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p850">“My friend, you did well to come to yourself,” he continued, addressing Raskolnikov.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p851">For four days you have not, so to speak, drunk or eaten anything. You could scarcely take a little tea, which was given to you with a spoon. I brought Zosimoff to you twice. Do you remember Zosimoff? He examined you attentively, and said that it was nothing. Your illness, he said, is a simple nervous weakness, the result of bad food, but it is not serious. A fine fellow, Zosimoff! He is already a great physician. But I do not want to abuse your time, added Razumihin, addressing himself again to the artelchtchik.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p852">"Please state the reason for your visit. Notice, Rodya, that they have come for the second time from their place. Only, the first time it was not this one. Who was it that came here before you?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p853">“You mean the one who came the day before yesterday, Alexis Semenovitch? He is also employed here.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p854">— He has a better tongue than you. Don't you think so?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p855">— Yes; he is a more capable man.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p856">— Modesty worthy of praise! Come, go on.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p857">“Listen: at the request of your mother, Afanasy Ivanovitch Vakhrushin, of whom you have probably heard more than once, has sent you some money, which our house is charged to deliver to you,” began the artel-chief, addressing Raskolnikov directly.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p858">"If you are in your right mind, please take delivery of these thirty-five roubles, which Semyon Semyonovitch received for you from Afanasy Ivanovitch, acting on your mother's request. You must have been notified of this shipment?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p859">"Yes, I remember," said Raskolnikov thoughtfully, "Vakhroushin."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p860">— Would you like a receipt?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p861">"He is going to sign. You have your book there?" said Razumihin.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p862">— Yes. Here,</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p863">— Give it here. Come, Rodia, a little effort; try to sit up. I will support you; take the pen and hurry to write your name, for, my friend, in our time, money is the honey of humanity.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p864">“I don't need it,” said Raskolnikov, pushing the pen away.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p865">— How do you mean, you don't need it?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p866">— I will not sign.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p867">— But you must give a receipt, don't you?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p868">— I don't need… money…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p869">"You don't need money!" For that, my friend, you are lying, I am a witness! Do not worry, I beg you, he does not know what he is saying ... he has gone back to the land of dreams. Besides, it happens to him even in his waking state ... You are a man of sense, we will guide his hand, and he will sign. Come on, come to my aid ...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p870">— But, in any case, I can come back.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p871">"No, no; why should you trouble yourself? You are a reasonable man. Come, Rodya, don't keep this visitor waiting any longer; you see he is waiting," and seriously Razumihin was about to take Raskolnikov's hand.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p872">“Leave it to me,” said the latter; he took the pen and wrote his receipt in the book. The artelchik handed over the money and withdrew.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p873">"Bravo!" And now, my friend, will you eat?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p874">"Yes," replied Raskolnikov.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p875">— Is there any soup?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p876">"There is some left from yesterday," replied Nastasia, who had not left the room during the whole scene.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p877">— Rice and potato soup?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p878">— Yes.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p879">"I was sure of it. Go and get the soup, and give us some tea."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p880">— All right.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p881">Raskolnikov watched all this with profound surprise and a dazed terror. He resolved to keep silent and wait for what would happen. “It seems to me that I am no longer delirious,” he thought, — “all this seems to be quite real… ”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p882">In ten minutes Nastasia came in with the soup, and announced that the tea would be ready directly. With the soup came two spoons, two plates, and a whole service of tableware: salt, pepper, mustard for the beef, etc.; the table had not been so well laid for a long time. Even the tablecloth was clean.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p883">"Nastasya," said Razumihin, "Praskoviya Pavlovna would not be amiss to send us two little bottles of beer. We'll get through them."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p884">"You don't let yourself be short of anything, do you!" grumbled the servant. And she went to do the errand.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p885">The invalid continued to observe everything with anxious attention. Meanwhile, Razumihin had come and sat down beside him on the sofa. With the grace of a bear, he held Raskolnikov's head against his left arm, which was not at all necessary, while with his right hand he brought a spoonful of soup to his mouth, after blowing on it several times so that his friend would not burn himself swallowing it. However, the soup was almost cold. Raskolnikov eagerly swallowed three spoonfuls, but then Razumihin abruptly suspended his office, declaring that for the rest he had to consult Zosimoff.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p886">Meanwhile, Nastasia brought in the two bottles of beer.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p887">"Would you like some tea?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p888">— Yes.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p889">“Quick, Nastasia, bring the tea, for I think that in the case of this beverage, the permission of the Faculty is not necessary. But here is the beer!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p890">He went back to his chair, brought the soup tureen and the beef closer to him, and began to devour them with as much appetite as if he hadn't eaten for three days.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p891">"Now, my dear Rodya, I dine here every day," he said with his mouth full, "it's your kind landlady, Pachenka, who gives me such a good dinner, she has a great regard for me. Of course, I let her do it. Why should I object? But here comes Nastasia with the tea. She's a quick girl. Nastenka, will you have some beer?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p892">— Are you mocking me?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p893">— But will you have some tea?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p894">— Tea, yes.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p895">“Help yourself. Or rather, no, wait, I'll serve you myself. Sit down at the table.” Immediately entering into his role of host, he filled two cups in succession; then he left his breakfast there and went to sit down on the sofa. As before, when it was a matter of soup, Razumikhin gave Raskolnikov tea with the most delicate attentions. The latter let himself be pampered without a word, although he felt perfectly capable of sitting on the sofa without anyone's help, holding the cup or spoon in his hand, and perhaps even walking. But, with a strange and almost instinctive Machiavellianism, he had suddenly decided to feign weakness for the moment, to simulate even, if necessary, a certain stupidity, while keeping his eyes and ears open. Besides, disgust was stronger than his resolution: after swallowing ten spoonfuls of tea, the patient freed his head with a brusque movement, capriciously pushed away the spoon, and let himself fall back on his pillow. This word was no longer a metaphor. Raskolnikov now had a good feather pillow at his bedside, with a clean pillowcase; this detail, which he had also noticed, was not without intrigue,</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p896">"Pachenka must send us some raspberry jam today, to make a drink for Rodya," said Razumihin, sitting down again and resuming his interrupted meal.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p897">"And where will she get raspberries?" asked Nastasia, who, holding her saucer on her five spread fingers, was sipping her tea "through the sugar."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p898">"My dear, she will get some raspberry juice at a shop. You see, Rodia, there has been a whole story here that you are not aware of. When you ran away from me like a thief without telling me where you lived, I was so angry that I decided to find you and take exemplary revenge on you. From that day on, I set out on my campaign. What I ran, what I asked! I had forgotten your current address, and for good reason: I had never known it. As for your old apartment, I only remembered that you lived at the Five Corners, Kharlamoff House. I set off on this trail, I discover the Kharlamoff house, which, in the end, is not the Kharlamoff house, but the Boukh house. That's how you sometimes get confused with proper names! I was furious; the next day I went to the address bureau, not counting on the result of this step. Well! imagine that in two minutes I was given the indication of your home. You are registered there.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p899">— Am I enrolled?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p900">"I should think so! And they couldn't give the address of General Kobylyov to someone who asked for it. I'll cut it short. I had hardly arrived here before I was initiated into all your affairs; yes, my friend, all of them. I know everything; Nastasia will tell you. I made the acquaintance of Nikodim Fomitch, I was shown Ilia Petrovitch, I got into relations with the dvornik, with Alexander Grigorievitch Zametov, the head of the chancellery, and finally with Pachenka herself, that was the climax; you can ask Nastasia..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p901">“You have embellished it,” the servant said with a sly smile.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p902">"The trouble, my dear fellow, is that you started wrong from the very beginning. You should not have gone about it that way with her. Her character is most peculiar! We will talk about her character later, however... But how, for example, did you manage to get her to cut off your allowance? And that bill of exchange! You must have been mad to sign it! And that marriage proposal, while her daughter Nathalie Egorovna was still alive!... I know all about it! I see, by the way, that I am touching a sensitive spot and that I am an ass; forgive me. But, speaking of stupidity, don't you think Praskovia Pavlovna is less stupid than one might suppose at first glance, eh?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p903">"Yes," muttered Raskolnikov, looking away; he did not understand that it would have been better to keep up the conversation.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p904">"Isn't that so?" cried Razumihin. "But she's not an intelligent woman either, is she?" "She's a most original type, I assure you, my dear fellow. I'm quite at a loss to understand her. She's forty, but she declares she's only thirty-six, and she's quite right in doing so. She's a perfect child, impulsive, emotional, and jolly. I'm very fond of her, but I don't understand her at all. To return to business, she saw that you were in difficulties, that you were going to the university and had no money, and that your clothes were shabby, and so she made up her mind to take you under her wing. She's a kind-hearted woman, and you have to be grateful to her for that. She's taken you in, and she's looking after you as though you were her son. She's not so bad as you think, you know. She's a good woman, but she's eccentric, and she has a lot of nonsense in her head. But she's kind-hearted and good-natured, and she's fond of you, and you'll be able to get on with her if you're patient."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p905">"I did a mean thing in saying that," Raskolnikov said in a clear, ringing voice. "My mother is almost reduced to begging herself. I lied so that they would continue to give me a place to live and... to feed me."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p906">Yes, you were perfectly right to speak in that way. What spoiled everything was the intervention of Mr. Tchebaroff, a court councillor and a man of business. Without him, Pachenka would have done nothing against you; she is much too timid for that. But the man of business is not timid, and first of all, naturally, he asked the question: Is the person who signed the bill of exchange solvent? Answer: Yes, for his mother, although she has only a pension of one hundred and twenty-five roubles, would starve herself to get Rodion out of trouble, and he has a sister who would sell herself as a slave for her brother. Mr. Tchebaroff acted on that... Why are you fidgeting? Now, my friend, I have understood your ulterior motive. You were not wrong to pour out your heart to Pachenka, at the time when she could see in you a future son-in-law; but there you are! while the honest and sensitive man gives himself up to confidences, the man of business collects them and makes his profit out of them. In short, she passed her bill in payment to this Tchebaroff, who did not hesitate to take you in. When I learned all this, I wanted, to clear my conscience, to treat the man of business with electricity too; but in the meantime harmony was established between Pachenka and me, and I stopped the proceedings by answering for your debt. You understand, my friend? I stood surety for you. Tchebaroff was called in, ten roubles were put into his mouth, and he returned the paper, which I have the honor of presenting to you.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p907">— Now you are only a debtor on parole. Here, take it.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p908">"Was it you I did not recognize when I was delirious?" asked Raskolnikov after a moment of silence.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p909">“Yes, and even my presence caused you to have attacks, especially the time when I brought Zamétoff.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p910">“Zamétoff? The head of the chancellery? Why did you bring him?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p911">As he uttered these words, Raskolnikov had suddenly changed his position, and now he kept his eyes fixed on Razumihin.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p912">“But what is the matter with you? Why are you so upset? He wanted to meet you; he himself wanted to come, because we had talked about you so much together… Otherwise, from whom would I have learned so much about you? He is an excellent fellow, my friend; he is wonderful… in his own way, naturally. Now we are friends; we see each other almost every day. I have, in fact, just moved my household to this neighborhood. You didn't know that yet? I moved in recently. I have been to Louise's with him twice. You remember Louise… Louise Ivanovna?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p913">— I was out in the country while I had the fever?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p914">— I believe it! You were no longer your own.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p915">— What was I saying?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p916">“What you were saying? We know well what a man who has lost his head can say… Come on, now, there is no time to waste; let us attend to our business.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p917">He stood up and put on his cap.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p918">— What was I saying?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p919">"You are determined to know, are you? You are afraid you have let out some secret? Be reassured: you have not said a word about the countess. But you have talked a great deal about a bulldog, earrings, watch chains, Krestovsky Island, a dvornik; Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, the police superintendent's assistant, also came up often in your conversation. Besides, you were very much concerned about one of your boots. "Give it to me!" you kept on saying, weeping. Zametov himself looked for it everywhere, and he brought you that dirty thing, which he did not hesitate to take in his white, perfumed hands, covered with rings. Then you calmed down, and for twenty-four hours you kept that filth in your hands: you could not tear it away from you, it must still be somewhere under your blanket."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p920">You also asked for the fringes of a pair of trousers, and with what tears! We would have liked to know what interest these fringes had for you, but it was impossible to understand your words ... Come on! now, to our business! Here are thirty-five rubles, I take ten, and in two hours I will come to you to report on the use I have made of them. In the meantime, I will go to Zosimoff; he should have been here long ago, because it is past eleven. In my absence, Nastenka, make sure that your tenant does not lack anything, and especially take care of preparing him to drink ... Besides, I will give my instructions to Pachenka myself. Goodbye!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p921">"He calls her Pachenka! Ah, the horrid scoundrel!" said the servant, as he turned the corner; then she went out and listened at the door; but after a moment she could not contain herself, and ran down herself, very curious to know what Razumihin was talking about with the landlady; Nastasia, it was clear, was in love with the student.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p922">As soon as she had closed the door behind her, the sick man threw back his bedclothes and jumped, as if in a panic, out of bed. He had been waiting with feverish impatience for the moment when he would be alone, so that he could set to work immediately. But what work? That was what he could not remember now. "Lord! tell me only one thing: do they know everything or do they not know it yet? Perhaps they know already, but they are pretending not to know because I am ill at the moment; they are keeping the mask on until they see me recovered: then they will tell me that they have known everything for a long time... What am I to do now? It is as if it were on purpose: I have forgotten it, and I was thinking about it only a minute ago!..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p923">He stood in the middle of the room, looking around him in a state of painful perplexity. He went to the door, opened it, and listened; but that was not it. Suddenly his memory seemed to return to him: he ran to the corner where the tapestry was torn, put his hand in the hole and began to feel around; but that was not it either. He went to open the stove and rummaged through the ashes: the fringes of the trousers and the lining of the pocket were still there as he had thrown them in: so no one had looked in the stove!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p924">Then he remembered the boot of which Razumihin had spoken. It was, indeed, lying on the sofa, under the blanket; but since the crime it had been so rubbed and so covered with mud that, no doubt, Zametov had not noticed it.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p925">"Bah! Zametov!... the police station! But why am I being called to this station? Where is the summons? Bah! I was confused: it was the other day that I was called! That day I also examined the boot, but now... now I was sick. But why did Zametov come here? Why did Razumikhin bring him?..." Raskolnikov murmured, sitting down exhausted on the sofa.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p926">"What is happening? Am I still delirious, or are things as I see them? It seems to me that I am not dreaming... Ah! now I remember: I must leave, leave as soon as possible, it is absolutely necessary! Yes... but where to go? And where are my clothes? No boots! They took them! They hid them! I understand! Ah! here is my overcoat, it escaped their attention! There is money on the table, thank God! The bill of exchange is there too... I will take the money and go, I will rent another apartment, they will not find me!... Yes, but the address bureau? They will find me! Razumikhin will be able to find me. It is better to leave the country, to go far away... to America: there I will make fun of them! I must also take the bill of exchange... it will be useful to me there. What else will I take? They think I am sick! They think I am not able to walk, hee, hee, hee!... I read in their eyes that they know everything! I only have to go down the stairs! But if the house was guarded, if, downstairs, I would find police officers? What is that? tea? Ah! there is also beer left, it will refresh me!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p927">He took the bottle, which still contained the equivalent of a large glass, and drank it down at a draught with real enjoyment, for his chest was on fire. But less than a minute later the beer caused a buzzing in his head, and a slight, even pleasant, shiver ran down his back. He lay down and pulled the blanket over him. His thoughts, already sick and incoherent, began to grow more and more confused. Soon his eyelids grew heavy. He laid his head voluptuously on the pillow, wrapped himself more tightly in the soft, padded blanket that had replaced his wretched coat, and fell into a deep sleep.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p928">At the sound of footsteps he woke up and saw Razumihin, who had just opened the door, but hesitated to enter the room and stood on the threshold. Raskolnikov sat up quickly and looked at his friend with the air of a man who tries to recall something.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p929">"Since you are not asleep, here I am! Nastasia, bring up the parcel," cried Razumihin to the servant downstairs.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p930">– I'll give you my accounts…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p931">"What time is it?" asked the patient, casting a frightened look around him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p932">“You've had a good sleep, my friend; the day is fading, it's almost six o'clock. Your sleep lasted more than six hours.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p933">“Lord! How could I have slept so long!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p934">“What are you complaining about? It's good for you! What urgent business did you have? A rendezvous, perhaps? Now we have all the time in the world. I've been waiting for you to wake up since three o'clock; I've already been to your place twice, but you were asleep. I've also been to Zosimoff's twice; he was out, but that doesn't matter, he'll come. Besides, I had to take care of my own business, I moved today, I had to move everything, including my uncle. You see, I have my uncle living with me now… Come on, enough talking, now to our business!… Give me the package, Nastasia. We're leaving right away… But how are you feeling, my friend?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p935">"I am well; I am not ill… Razumihin, have you been here long?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p936">“I have just told you that I have been waiting for you to wake up for three hours.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p937">— No, but before that?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p938">— How, before?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p939">— How long have you been coming here?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p940">“But, come now, I told you just now: don't you remember?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p941">Raskolnikov tried to recall the events of the day. They appeared to him like a dream. His efforts at recollection being fruitless, he looked at Razumihin.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p942">"Hm!" said the other, "you have forgotten. I noticed just now that you were not quite yourself. But sleep has done you good. You look much better now. Come, never mind. It will come back to you in a moment. Look here, my dear fellow."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p943">He began to undo the package, which was obviously the object of all his preoccupations.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p944">"That, my friend, was particularly close to my heart. It is necessary to make a man of you. We shall set about it. Let us begin at the top. Do you see this cap?" he said, taking from the package a rather pretty cap, though very ordinary and of little value. "Will you allow me to try it on you?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p945">“Not now, later,” said Raskolnikov, pushing his friend away with an impatient gesture.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p946">"No, at once, Rodia, my dear boy, let me do it; it would be too late later; and besides, I should be worried all night, for I bought it at random, not knowing the size of your head. It fits perfectly!" he cried triumphantly, after trying the cap on Raskolnikov:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p947">"That's it exactly," he said, "you'd swear it was made to order. Guess how much I paid for it, Nastasiushka," he said to the maid, seeing that his friend was silent.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p948">"Two grivnas, of course," said Nastasia.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p949">"Two grivnas, you are mad!" cried Razumihin, irritated.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p950">— Now for two grivnas they wouldn't even buy you, eight grivnas! And that's only because it's been worn. Now let's get to the pants, I warn you I'm proud of them!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p951">He then spread out a pair of gray trousers, made of a light summer fabric, before Raskolnikov.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p952">Not a hole, not a stain, and very wearable, though it has also been worn; the vest is the same color as the trousers, as fashion demands. Besides, if these effects are not new, to tell the truth, they are only better: they have acquired by use more softness, more softness ... You see, Rodia, in my opinion, to make your way in the world, you must always adjust to the season. Reasonable people do not eat asparagus in January: I followed this principle in my purchases. It is summer, so I bought summer clothes. When autumn comes, you will need warmer clothes, and you will abandon these ... all the more so since, by then, they will have had time to wear out. Well, guess what it cost! How much do you think?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p953">"Two roubles and twenty-five kopecks! Now, let's talk about the boots; how do you like them? They're a bit worn, but they'll still do for two months, because they were made abroad: a secretary from the British embassy got rid of them last week; he'd only had them for six days, but he was very short of money. Price: one rouble fifty kopecks. It's a bargain."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p954">"But they may not fit her feet," observed Nastasia.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p955">"They won't fit his foot! And what's this?" Razumihin asked, pulling out of his pocket a pair of Raskolnikov's old boots, which were all torn and dirty. "I took my precautions; they took the measure from this horror. Everything was done very conscientiously. But with the linen there was a bit of a wrangle with the merchant. At last you have three linen shirts with fashionable frontlets. Now, let's count up: cap, eight grivnas; trousers and waistcoat, two roubles twenty-five kopecks; boots, one rouble fifty kopecks; linen, five roubles; total, nine roubles fifty-five kopecks. So I have forty-five kopecks to give you; here, take it; and now you're all right, for your overcoat, in my opinion, is not only still serviceable, but has a certain style; it's evident it was made by Charmer! As for socks, etc., I left you to buy them yourself. We have twenty-five roubles left, and you needn't worry about Pachenka or the rent. I told you: you're given unlimited credit. Now, my friend, let me change your linen; it's necessary, for the disease is in your shirt..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p956">"Leave me alone! I don't want to!" answered Raskolnikov, whose face had remained gloomy throughout Razumikhin's cheerful narrative.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p957">"It is necessary, my friend; why else have I worn out my boots?" insisted the latter.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p958">"Nastasya, don't be prudish, and come and help me here!" and, in spite of Raskolnikov's resistance, he succeeded in changing his linen.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p959">The patient fell back on his pillow and said nothing for two minutes.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p960">"Are they not going to leave me in peace at last?" he thought.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p961">"With what money has all this been bought?" he asked next, looking at the wall.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p962">“That's a question! But with your own money. Your mother sent you thirty-five roubles through Vakhrushin, which were brought to you just now, have you forgotten?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p963">"I remember now," said Raskolnikov after a long silence, during which he had been sitting in gloomy thought. Razumihin, with knitted brows, looked at him with uneasiness.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p964">The door opened, and a tall man entered the room. His manner of presenting himself indicated that he was a familiar visitor to Raskolnikov.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p965">"Zosimoff! At last!" cried Razumihin joyfully.</p>
