<h2 class="calibre7" id="h29">II</h2>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p766">"And if the search had already begun? If, on arriving, I found them at my place?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p767">Here is his room. Everything is in order; no one has been here. Nastasia herself has not touched anything. But, Lord! how could he have left all these things in such a hiding place?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p768">He ran to the corner, and, putting his hand under the tapestry, he drew out the jewels, which were found to be eight in number. There were two small boxes containing earrings or something of the kind, — he did not notice exactly what, — then four small morocco cases. A watch chain was simply wrapped in a piece of newspaper. So was another object which must have been a decoration…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p769">Raskolnikov put everything in his pockets, doing his best to make them not look too full. He also took the purse, then he left his room, this time leaving the door wide open.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p770">He walked with a quick and firm step; although he felt completely broken, his presence of mind did not fail him. He was afraid of a pursuit, he feared that in half an hour, perhaps in a quarter of an hour, an investigation would begin against him; therefore, it was necessary to make the evidence disappear as soon as possible. He had to fulfill this task while he still had some strength and composure left... But where to go?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p771">This question had been settled long ago: "I'll throw it all into the canal, and the whole thing will be over and done with"; that's what he had decided the night before, in those moments of delirium when he had several times wanted to get up and "throw it all away quickly." But the execution of this plan was not so easy.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p772">For a half hour, perhaps longer, he wandered along the Catherine Canal embankment, examining, as he came to them, the various stairways leading down to the water. Unfortunately, some obstacle always stood in the way of his plan. Here it was a boat of laundresses, there some skiffs moored to the bank. Besides, the embankment was crowded with promenaders who would not have failed to notice such an unusual action; a man could not, without arousing suspicion, go down to the water's edge on purpose, stop there, and throw something into the canal. And if, as was to be expected, the caskets floated instead of sinking? Everyone would notice it. Raskolnikov even began to think that he was the object of general attention; he imagined that everyone was talking about him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p773">Finally, the young man thought that it would perhaps be better to go and throw these objects into the Neva: there, in fact, there was less crowd on the quay, he would be less likely to be noticed, and, an important consideration, he would be further away from his neighborhood. "How is it," Raskolnikoff suddenly asked himself in astonishment, "how is it that for half an hour I have been wandering anxiously in places that are not safe for me? The objections that now present themselves to my mind, could I not have made them earlier? If I have just lost half an hour looking for the fulfillment of an insane project, it is only because my resolution was made in a moment of delirium!" He was becoming singularly distracted and forgetful, and he knew it. Decidedly he had to hurry!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p774">He went towards the Neva along the V… Prospect; but on the way another idea suddenly occurred to him: "Why go to the Neva? Why throw these things into the water? Wouldn't it be better to go somewhere far away, to an island, for example? There I would find a lonely spot, a wood, and I would bury all this at the foot of a tree which I would take care to notice attentively so that I could recognize it later." Although he felt himself then incapable of making a judicious decision, this idea seemed practical to him, and he resolved to put it into execution.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p775">But chance decided otherwise. As Raskolnikov emerged from V… Prospect into the square, he suddenly noticed on the left the entrance to a courtyard, which was surrounded on all sides by high walls and whose floor was covered with black dust. In the back was a shed that was obviously part of some workshop; there must have been a carpentry shop, a saddlery, or something similar.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p776">Seeing no one in the courtyard, Raskolnikov crossed the threshold of the door, and, after glancing around him, said to himself that no place would offer him more facilities for the accomplishment of his project. Just then, against the wall, or rather the wooden fence which bordered the street to the left of the door, was leaning a huge unhewn stone, of about sixty pounds weight.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p777">On the other side of the fence was the sidewalk, and the young man could hear the noise of the passers-by, always quite numerous in that place; but from the outside no one could see him; for that, someone would have had to enter the courtyard, which, moreover, was not impossible; so he had to hurry.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p778">He bent down to the stone, seized it with both hands by the top, and, gathering all his strength, succeeded in overturning it. The ground, at the spot it occupied, had been slightly depressed: he threw immediately into the hollow all that he had in his pockets. The purse was placed over the jewels, but the hollow was not entirely filled. Then he raised the stone and succeeded in replacing it just where it was before; at most it appeared a little higher. But he pressed the earth against the edges with his foot. Nothing could be noticed.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p779">Then he went out and headed for the square. As before at the police station, an intense joy, almost impossible to bear, seized him for an instant. "The evidence buried! Who will have the idea of looking under that stone? It may have been there since the neighboring house was built, and God knows how long it will be there! And even if they discover what is hidden underneath, who can suspect that it was me who hid it? It's all over! There is no evidence! " And he began to laugh. Yes, he remembered later that he had crossed the square laughing all the time, with a little nervous, silent, prolonged laugh. But when he reached the Boulevard de K..., this hilarity suddenly ceased.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p780">All his thoughts now revolved around one main point, the importance of which he himself acknowledged; he felt that now, for the first time in two months, he was left alone with this question.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p781">"But the devil take it all!" he said to himself in a sudden fit of anger. "Well, the wine is drawn, and it must be drunk; plague take the new life! How stupid it is, Lord!... And what lies I have told, what baseness I have committed to-day! What shameful flattery I poured out just now to conciliate the benevolence of the detestable Ilia Petrovitch! But, after all, it matters little! I don't care a straw for them all and for the baseness I have committed! It is not that that matters! Not at all!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p782">He stopped suddenly, confused, stunned by a new question, completely unexpected and extremely simple:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p783">"If you really acted in this whole affair as an intelligent man and not as an imbecile, if you had a clearly defined and firmly pursued goal, how is it that so far you have not even looked at what is in the purse? How is it that you still do not know what the act you did not hesitate to assume the danger and infamy brings you? Didn't you want to throw this purse and these jewels into the water, which you barely glanced at? ... What does it look like? "</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p784">Arriving on the quay of the Little Neva, in Vasili Ostroff, he stopped suddenly near the bridge. "It is here, it is in this house that he lives, he thought. What does it mean? It seems that my legs have led me of their own accord to Razumikhin's house! Again the same story as the other day... But it is very curious: I was walking without a goal, and chance has brought me here! No matter; I said... the day before yesterday... that I would go to see him after<i class="calibre4">that</i>"Well, I'll go and see him tomorrow. What's to prevent me from paying a visit?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p785">He went up to the fifth floor, where his friend lived.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p786">The latter was in his little room, writing, and he went to open the door himself. The two young men had not seen each other for four months. Dressed in a dressing-gown all torn, with bare feet in slippers, and his hair dishevelled, Razumihin was neither shaved nor washed. Surprise was depicted on his face.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p787">"Well, well! is that you?" he cried, examining the newcomer from head to foot; then he became silent and began to whistle.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p788">"Is it possible that things are so bad? The fact is that you still surpass your servant in elegance," he continued, after glancing at his friend's rags. "But sit down, I see you are tired!" And when Raskolnikov had thrown himself down on a Turkish divan covered with oilcloth and even more wretched than his own, Razumihin suddenly noticed that his visitor was ill.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p789">"You are seriously ill, do you know that?" He wanted to feel his pulse, but Raskolnikov quickly withdrew his hand.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p790">"It's useless," he said, "I came...here's why: I don't have any lessons...I wanted...besides, I don't need lessons at all..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p791">"Do you know what? You're talking nonsense!" observed Razumihin, who was watching his friend attentively.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p792">"No, I'm not raving," answered Raskolnikov, rising. When he went up to Razumihin's he had not expected that he would be face to face with his friend. And yet a face-to-face encounter with anyone at all was the most terrible thing he could imagine at that moment. He was filled with hatred, and he almost choked with rage at himself as soon as he crossed Razumihin's threshold.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p793">"Good-bye!" he said abruptly, and he went towards the door.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p794">“But stay here, you're so funny!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p795">"It is useless!" he repeated, freeing his hand which his friend had seized.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p796">— Then why the devil did you come? Have you lost your mind? Come, it's almost an insult you're doing me. I won't let you go like this.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p797">“Well, listen: I came to you because I know no one else who can help me… to begin with… because you are better than all of them, that is, more intelligent, and you can appreciate… But now I see that I need nothing, you understand, nothing at all… I do not need anyone's services or sympathy… I am sufficient unto myself! Let me be left in peace!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p798">“But wait a minute, chimney sweep! You're completely mad! You can say what you like, but that's my opinion. You see, I don't have any lessons either, but I don't care, I have a bookseller, Khérouvimoff, who, in his own way, is a lesson. I wouldn't trade him for five lessons at the market. He publishes little books on natural science, and they sell like hotcakes! The only thing is to find titles! You always said I was stupid: well, my friend, there are people more stupid than me! My publisher, who personally doesn't know a thing about natural science,<i class="calibre4">a</i>ni<i class="calibre4">b</i>has taken up the tone of the day; I, of course, encourage him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p799">Here, for example, are two and a half sheets of German text: it is, in my opinion, the most foolish charlatanism; the author examines the question of whether woman is a man; naturally he holds for the affirmative and demonstrates it in a triumphant way. I am translating this pamphlet for Khérouvimoff, who considers it topical at a time when the question of women is being discussed. We will make six sheets with the two and a half sheets of the German original, we will add a pompous title that will take half a page, and we will sell it for fifty kopecks. It will be a success! My translation is paid at the rate of six rubles per sheet, which makes fifteen rubles in total, and I have received six in advance.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p800">Come, will you translate the second sheet? If so, take the text, take pens, paper, — all this is at the expense of the State, — and allow me to offer you three rubles: since I myself received six rubles in advance for the first and second sheets, it is three rubles that come back to you, and you will have as much to touch when your translation is finished. Above all, do not imagine that you owe me any obligation for this. On the contrary, as soon as you entered, I immediately thought of using you. First, I am not strong on spelling, and secondly, I have a pitiful knowledge of German, so that most often I invent instead of translating. I console myself with the thought that I thus add beauties to the text, but who knows? I may be deluding myself. Well, it is said, do you accept?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p801">Raskolnikov took the pages of the German pamphlet and the three roubles in silence, and went out without a word. Razumihin followed him with an astonished look. But, reaching the first turning, Raskolnikov suddenly turned back, and went up to his friend again. He put the pages of the pamphlet and the three roubles on the table, and said: "I'm going now to the old woman's," and he went out again.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p802">"But this is madness!" cried Razumihin at last, getting angry.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p803">— What comedy are you playing? You even make me lose my composure… Why did you come then, damn it?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p804">“I don't need… translations…” Raskolnikov muttered, already on his way down the stairs.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p805">"What do you need, then, devil take it?" shouted Razumihin from the landing.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p806">The visitor continued down in silence.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p807">"Eh! say, where do you live?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p808">This question received no answer.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p809">“Well, go to the devil!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p810">But Raskolnikov was already in the street.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p811">The young man arrived home in the evening, without being able to say where he had returned from. Trembling all over his body like a tired horse, he undressed, lay down on the sofa, and, after placing his coat over him, fell asleep immediately.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p812">Darkness had already fallen when he was awakened by a terrible noise. What a frightful scene was taking place, my God! There were cries, groans, gnashing of teeth, tears, blows, insults, such as he had never heard or seen. Terrified, he sat up in bed; his fear grew from minute to minute, for at every moment the sound of the blows struck, the complaints, the invectives reached his ears more clearly. And then, to his extreme surprise, he suddenly recognized the voice of his landlady.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p813">The poor woman was moaning and begging in a plaintive tone. It was impossible to understand what she was saying, but she was probably asking to be left alone, because she was being beaten mercilessly in the stairwell. The brute who was abusing her was shouting in a hoarse, strangled voice, so that his words were also incomprehensible. Suddenly Raskolnikov began to tremble like a leaf: he had just recognized that voice; it was Ilia Petrovich's. “Ilia Petrovich is here, and he is beating the landlady! He is kicking her, he is banging her head against the steps, — it is clear, I am not mistaken, the noise of the blows, the cries of the victim indicate what kind of violence is taking place! What is this? Is the world upside down?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p814">From all the floors people were running down the stairs; voices, exclamations were heard; people were coming up, doors were violently slammed or banged shut. "But why? Why? How is this possible?" he repeated, seriously believing that madness was taking possession of his brain. But no, he perceived these noises too distinctly! ... "Well, then, if that is the case, they will come to my room, for ... all this, certainly, is for the thing ... of yesterday ... Lord!" He wanted to lock himself in with the hook, but he did not have the strength to raise his arm ... Besides, he felt that it would be useless! Fear froze his soul ...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p815">After lasting for a good ten minutes, all this uproar gradually died down. The landlady was moaning. Ilia Petrovich continued to spew out insults and threats… At last, he himself fell silent, at least he was no longer heard. “Has he gone away? Lord!” Yes, here the landlady is going away too, she is still crying and moaning… The door of her room slams shut noisily… The tenants leave the staircase to return to their respective apartments; — they utter “ah!” they argue, they call each other, sometimes shouting, sometimes speaking in a low voice. They must have been very numerous; almost the entire house had rushed there. “But, my God, is all this possible? And why, why did he come here?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p816">Raskolnikoff fell exhausted on the sofa, but he could not close his eyes; for half an hour he was in a state of terror such as he had never experienced before. Suddenly a bright light illumined his room: it was Nastasia, who came in with a candle and a plate of soup. The servant looked at him attentively, and, having convinced herself that he was not asleep, she put her candle on the table, and began to unpack what she had brought: bread, salt, a plate, and a spoon.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p817">“I think you haven't eaten since yesterday. You've been wandering the streets all day with a fever in your body.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p818">“Nastasia… why was the boss beaten?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p819">She looked at him fixedly.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p820">— Who beat the boss?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p821">— Just now… half an hour ago, Ilia Petrovitch, the assistant police commissioner, beat her on the stairs… Why did he beat her so? And why did he come?…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p822">Nastasia frowned, said nothing, and examined the lodger for a long time. This inquisitive look confused him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p823">“Nastasia, why are you silent?” he asked at last in a timid and weak voice.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p824">"It is blood," she murmured, as if speaking to herself.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p825">"Blood!... What blood?" he stammered, turning pale, and he recoiled against the wall.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p826">Nastasia continued to observe him in silence.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p827">"No one beat the boss," she said again, with a peremptory air.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p828">He looked at her, barely breathing.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p829">I heard it myself… I wasn't asleep… I was sitting on the sofa, he said in a more fearful voice than ever.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p830">— I listened for a long time… The deputy police commissioner came… Everyone came running up the stairs from all the apartments…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p831">— No one came. But it's the blood that screams inside you. When it has no outlet and begins to form clots, then you see things… Are you going to eat?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p832">He made no reply; Nastasia did not leave the room, and continued to look at him with a curious eye.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p833">— Give me something to drink… Nastasie.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p834">She went down and returned two minutes later, bringing water in a little earthenware pot; but from that moment Raskolnikov's recollections ceased. He remembered only that he had drunk a mouthful of cold water. Then he had fainted.</p>
