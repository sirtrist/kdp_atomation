<h2 class="calibre7" id="h229"></h2>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3589">Raskolnikov's situation was strange: one would have said that a sort of fog enveloped him and isolated him from the rest of mankind. When, later, he recalled this period of his life, he guessed that he must sometimes have lost consciousness of himself, and that this state had lasted, with certain lucid intervals, until the final catastrophe. He was positively convinced that he had made many mistakes at that time; for example, that the chronological sequence of events had often escaped him. At least, when later he wanted to gather and put his memories in order, he was forced to resort to foreign testimonies to learn many details about himself.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3590">He confused one fact with another, or he considered a certain incident as the consequence of another which existed only in his imagination. At times he was dominated by a morbid fear which even degenerated into panic terror. But he also remembered that there had been moments, hours, and perhaps even days when, on the contrary, he was plunged into a gloomy apathy, comparable only to the indifference of certain dying people.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3591">In general, during these last few days, far from trying to make an exact account of his situation, he strove not to think about it. Certain facts of daily life, which could not be postponed, forced themselves on his attention in spite of himself; on the other hand, he neglected with pleasure the questions whose forgetting, in a position like his, could only be fatal to him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3592">He was especially afraid of Svidrigailov. Since the latter had repeated to him the words he had spoken in Sonia's room, Raskolnikov's thoughts had taken a new direction. But, although this unforeseen complication worried him extremely, the young man did not hasten to clear the matter up. Sometimes, when he had wandered into some remote and solitary quarter of the town, when he found himself sitting alone at a wretched tavern table without remembering how he had got there, he suddenly thought of Svidrigailov: he promised himself to have a decisive explanation with this man as soon as possible, this man whose thoughts obsessed him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3593">One day, when he had gone for a walk somewhere beyond the barrier, he even imagined that he had made an appointment with Svidrigailov at that place. Another time, waking up before dawn, he was very surprised to find himself lying on the ground in the middle of a thicket. Besides, during the two or three days that followed the death of Catherine Ivanovna, Raskolnikov had two opportunities to meet Svidrigailov: first in Sonia's room, then in the vestibule, near the staircase leading to the young girl's room.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3594">On these two occasions they exchanged only a few brief words, and avoided the main issue, as if by tacit agreement they had decided to postpone the question for the time being. The body of Katerina Ivanovna was still on the table. Svidrigailov was making arrangements for the funeral. Sonia was also very busy. In their last meeting, Svidrigailov told Raskolnikov that his efforts on behalf of Katerina Ivanovna's children had been successful: thanks to certain people he knew, he had been able to obtain the admission of the three children into very well-run orphanages; the fifteen hundred roubles placed on the head of each of them had not harmed this result, because orphans with a small capital were much more readily accepted than those who were completely without resources. He added a few words about Sonia, promised to come himself one of these days to Raskolnikov's and hinted that there were certain matters about which he very much wanted to talk to him... While he was speaking, Svidrigailov did not stop observing his interlocutor. Suddenly he fell silent, then he asked in a low voice:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3595">"But what is the matter with you, Rodion Romanovitch? You seem to be out of sorts. You listen and look, but you don't seem to understand! Collect your thoughts. We must have a talk together; unfortunately, I am very busy both with my own affairs and with other people's… Ah! Rodion Romanovitch," he added suddenly, "every man needs air, air, air… above all!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3596">He stepped aside quickly to let a priest and a sacristan pass, who were preparing to go up the stairs. They were coming to perform the funeral service. Svidrigailov had insisted that this ceremony be held regularly twice a day. He moved away, and Raskolnikov, after a moment's thought, followed the priest to Sonia's.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3597">He remained on the threshold. The service began with the quiet and sad solemnity customary. Since his childhood, Raskolnikov had felt a sort of mystical terror before the apparatus of death; so he usually avoided attending panikhidas. Besides, this one had a particularly moving character for him. He looked at the children: all three were kneeling near the coffin, Poletchka was crying. Behind them, Sonia was praying, trying to hide her tears. All these days, she has not raised her eyes to me once and has not said a single word! he thought suddenly. The sun cast a bright light into the room, where the smoke of incense rose in thick swirls.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3598">The priest read the usual prayer: "Give him, Lord, eternal rest!" Raskolnikov remained until the end. When giving the blessing and taking leave, the ecclesiastic looked around him with a strange air. After the service, Raskolnikov approached Sonia. She immediately took both his hands and laid her head on the young man's shoulder. This demonstration of friendship caused him a deep astonishment. What! Sonia did not show the slightest aversion, not the slightest horror for him, her hand did not tremble in the least! It was the height of personal self-abnegation. At least, that was how he judged it. The young girl said not a word. Raskolnikov shook her hand and went out.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3599">He felt an unbearable discomfort. If it had been possible for him at that moment to find solitude somewhere, even if that solitude had to last his whole life, he would have considered himself happy. Alas! for some time now, although he was almost always alone, he could not say that he was. He would go for walks outside the city, go down a main road; once he even went into a wood. But the more the place was solitary, the more Raskolnikov felt an invisible being near him, whose presence frightened him less than it irritated him. So he hurried back to the city; he mingled with the crowd, went into taverns and bars, went to the Tolkoutchii or the Siennaia. There he felt more at ease and even more alone.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3600">As night fell, songs were being sung in a tavern. He spent an hour listening to them and even took great pleasure in it. But in the end, his anxiety seized him again; a thought as poignant as remorse began to torture him:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3601">"I am here listening to songs, is that what I should be doing?" he said to himself. Besides, he guessed that this was not his only concern: another question had to be resolved without delay; but even though it imposed itself on his attention, he could not bring himself to give it a precise form. "No, it would be better to fight! better to find myself again in front of Porphyry ... or Svidrigailov ... Yes, yes, rather an adversary of any kind, an attack to repel!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3602">Upon this reflection, he left the tavern in haste. Suddenly, the thought of his mother and sister threw him into a sort of panic terror. He spent that night lying in the thickets of Krestowsky-Ostroff; before dawn, he awoke trembling with fever and took the road to his home, where he arrived at daybreak. After a few hours of sleep, the fever disappeared, but he awoke late, — at two o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3603">Raskolnikov remembered that it was the day set for the funeral of Katerina Ivanovna, and he was glad he had not been there. Nastasia brought him his meal. He ate and drank with a good appetite, almost with greed. His head was clearer, he felt a calm he had not known for three days. For a moment, he even wondered at the fits of panic terror to which he had been a prey. The door opened, and Razumihin entered.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3604">"Ah! he is eating, so he is not ill!" said the visitor, who took a chair and sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov. He was very agitated, and did not try to hide it. He spoke with evident anger, but without hurrying and without raising his voice very much. One could suppose that some serious motive had brought him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3605">"Listen," he began in a resolute tone, "I'm giving up on you all, because I now see, I see most clearly that your game is indecipherable to me. Don't think, I beg you, that I came to interrogate you. I don't care! I don't care to get anything out of you. Now, if you were to tell me everything yourself, all your secrets, it is very likely that I wouldn't want to hear them: I would spit and go away. I came solely to enlighten myself first personally on your mental state. You see? there are people who think you are mad or on the verge of being so. I admit that I myself was very much inclined to share this opinion, given that your way of acting is stupid, rather nasty, and perfectly inexplicable. On the other hand, what to think of your recent behavior towards your mother and sister? What man, unless he is a scoundrel or a madman, would have behaved towards them as you have done? So you are mad...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3606">— When did you see them?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3607">"I have just been there. And you don't see them any more? Tell me, please, where you have been roaming all day; I have been to your place three times. Since yesterday your mother has been seriously ill. She wanted to come to you. Avdotia Romanovna tried to dissuade her, but Pulcheria Alexandrovna would not listen: 'If he is ill, if he is out of his mind,' she said, 'who will look after him if not his mother?' In order not to let her go alone, we all came here, and on the way we kept begging her to calm down. When we arrived, you were out. Look, here is the place where she sat down, she stayed there for ten minutes; we stood next to her, not saying a word. 'If he is out,' she said, getting up, 'it means he is not ill and he is forgetting his mother; it is therefore improper for me to go begging for my son's caresses.' She went home and went to bed; now she has a fever: 'I can see,' she says, 'that he spends all his time with her.' She thinks that Sofya Semyonovna is your fiancée or your mistress. I went straight to that girl, because, my friend, I was eager to get to the bottom of it. I went in, and what did I see? A coffin, children crying, and Sofya Semyonovna trying on mourning clothes for them. You were not there. After looking for you with my eyes, I apologized, went out, and told Avdotia Romanovna the result of my visit. Definitely, all this means nothing, it is not a love affair: so the hypothesis of madness remains, as the most probable. And now I find you devouring boiled beef, as if you had not eaten for forty-eight hours! Of course, being mad does not prevent one from eating; but, although you have not said a word to me yet..., no, you are not mad, I would stake my life on it! This is a point beyond discussion for me. So I am sending you all to the devil, since there is a mystery here and I do not intend to break my head over your secrets. I came only to make a scene and relieve my heart. As for the rest, I now know what I have to do!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3608">— What are you going to do?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3609">— What does it matter to you?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3610">— Are you going to start drinking?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3611">— How did you guess that?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3612">"With that it was difficult to guess!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3613">Razumihin was silent for a moment.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3614">"You have always been very intelligent, and you have never, never been mad," he observed suddenly with vivacity. "You have spoken the truth: I am going to begin to drink. Adieu!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3615">And he took a step towards the door.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3616">"The day before yesterday, if I remember rightly, I spoke of you to my sister," said Raskolnikov.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3617">Razumihin stopped short.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3618">"Of me! But... where did you see her the day before yesterday?" he asked, turning a little pale. The agitation that agitated him could not be doubted.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3619">“She came here alone, sat down in this place, and talked with me.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3620">— Her?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3621">— Yes, her.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3622">— What did you tell him, then… about me, of course?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3623">"I told her you were an excellent man, honest and industrious. I did not tell her that you loved her, because she knows it."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3624">— She knows it?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3625">“Look here, by God! Wherever I go, whatever happens to me, you ought to remain their providence. I am, so to speak, handing them over to you, Razumihin. I tell you this because I know very well that you love her, and I am convinced of the purity of your feelings. I know, too, that she may love you, if she does not already. Now decide whether you must or must not take to drinking.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3626">"Rodka, you see... Well... Ah, the devil! But where are you going? You see, since all this is a secret, well, let's not talk about it anymore! But I... I will find out what it is... And I am convinced that there is nothing serious about it, that they are silly things that your imagination makes monsters of. Besides, you are an excellent man! An excellent man!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3627">— I was going to add — but you interrupted me — that you were perfectly right just now when you declared that you would renounce knowing these secrets. Don't worry about it. Things will be discovered in their time, and you will know everything when the time comes. Yesterday, someone told me that man needs air, air, air! I'm going to go ask him right away what he means by that.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3628">Razumikhin was thinking, and an idea came to him:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3629">"He is a political conspirator, for sure! And he is on the eve of some daring attempt, that is certain! It cannot be otherwise, and... and Dounia knows it..." he suddenly said to himself.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3630">"Avdotia Romanovna is coming to see you," he repeated, emphasizing each word; "and you yourself want to see someone who says that more air is needed. It is probable that the letter was also sent by that man," he added, as if to himself.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3631">— What letter?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3632">— She received a letter today that has greatly upset her. I tried to speak to her about you, but she asked me to be silent. Then… then she told me that we would probably be parting very soon, and she thanked me warmly. After that, she went to lock herself in her room.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3633">"Has she received a letter?" Raskolnikov asked again, becoming anxious.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3634">— Yes. Did you not know that? Hmmm…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3635">They both fell silent for a minute.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3636">"Farewell, Rodion. I, my friend, once had a time. Well, farewell! I must go too. As for drinking, no, I will not do it; it is useless."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3637">He went out quickly, but he had scarcely closed the door behind him when he suddenly opened it again and said, looking sideways:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3638">"By the way, do you remember that murder, the old woman's murder? Well, they've caught the murderer, he's confessed and given all the proofs. It was one of those painters I defended so hotly! Can you believe it? The chase of the two workers running up the stairs after each other while the dvornik and the two witnesses were coming up, the blows they gave each other while laughing, all that was just a trick the murderer thought up to divert suspicion! What cunning, what presence of mind that fellow has! It's hard to believe, but he himself explained everything, he made the most complete confession. And how wrong I was! Well, in my opinion, this man is the genius of dissimulation and cunning, after that you shouldn't be surprised by anything! Can't there be people like that? If he didn't keep up his role to the end, if he entered the path of confession, I am only more inclined to admit the truth of what he says. It makes the thing more plausible... But I had put my finger in my eye enough! How many lances did I break in favor of those two men!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3639">"Tell me, please: how did you learn this, and why is this case of such interest to you?" Raskolnikov asked, visibly agitated.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3640">— Why does she interest me? That's a question!… As for the facts, I have them from several people, notably Porphyre. He is the one who taught me almost everything.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3641">— Porphyry?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3642">— Yes.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3643">"Well, what did he say to you?" asked Raskolnikov, anxiously.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3644">“He explained it all to me in a wonderful way, using the psychological method, as he always does.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3645">“He explained that to you? Himself?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3646">"He himself, he himself; goodbye! I will tell you something else later, but now I am forced to leave you... There was a time when I thought... Come on, I'll tell you about it another day!... What do I need to drink now? Your words were enough to intoxicate me. At the moment, Rodka, I am drunk, drunk without having drunk a drop of wine... Goodbye, see you soon!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3647">He went out.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3648">"He is a political conspirator, that is positive, positive!" Razumihin concluded definitively, as he went down the stairs. "And he has drawn his sister into his undertaking; this conjecture is very probable, considering Avdotia Romanovna's character. They have had conversations... She has already let me suppose, by certain words... Now I understand what those words meant... those hints... Yes, that's it! Besides, where could one find another explanation for this mystery? Hm! And it had occurred to me... Oh Lord! What had I imagined! Yes, I had a lapse of judgment, and I have been guilty towards him! The other evening, in the corridor, when I saw his face lit up by the lamp, I had a moment of madness. Ugh! What a horrible idea I could have conceived! Mikolka did well to confess!... Yes, now everything in the past is explained: Rodion's illness, the strangeness of his behavior, that gloomy and savage mood he had even when he was a student... But what does this letter mean? Where did it come from? There is something else there. I suspect... Hm... No, I will get to the bottom of this."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3649">At the thought of Dounia, his heart grew cold and he stood rooted to the spot. He had to make a violent effort to continue his walk.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3650">As soon as Razumihin had gone, Raskolnikov got up, went to the window, then walked from one corner to another, apparently forgetting the narrow dimensions of his room. At last he sat down on the sofa. A complete renovation seemed to have taken place in him; he was going to have to fight again: that was an outlet!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3651">Yes, an outlet! A way to escape the painful situation, the suffocating conditions in which he had been living since the appearance of Mikolka at Porphyry's. After this dramatic incident, the same day, had taken place the scene at Sonia's, a scene whose twists and turns had completely deceived Raskolnikov's predictions. He had shown himself weak; he had recognized, in agreement with the young girl, and recognized sincerely that he could no longer bear such a burden alone! And Svidrigailov?... Svidrigailov was an enigma that worried him, but not in the same way. There was perhaps a way to get rid of Svidrigailov, while Porphyry was another matter.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3652">« So Porfiry himself explained to Razumihin the guilt of Mikolka by the method of the <i>a priori</i> hypothesis.<i class="calibre4">psychological !</i>"He has again brought in his accursed psychology!" Raskolnikov continued to think to himself. "Porphyry? But how could Porphyry have believed for a single instant that Mikolka was guilty after the scene that had just taken place between us, which admits of only one explanation? During that tête-à-tête, his words, his gestures, his looks, the sound of his voice, everything about him testified to such an invincible conviction that none of Mikolka's supposed confessions could have shaken him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3653">"But what? Razumihin himself was beginning to suspect something. The incident in the corridor had, no doubt, given him food for thought. He had run to Porfiry... But why did the latter mystify him so? What purpose did he have in deceiving Razumihin about Mikolka? Obviously, he did not do it without a reason, he must have had his intentions, but what are they? To tell the truth, quite a lot of time has passed since this morning, and I have not heard a word from Porfiry. Who knows, though, if it is not rather a bad sign?..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3654">Raskolnikov took his cap and, after having consulted with himself, decided to go out. That day, for the first time in a long time, he felt in full possession of his intellectual faculties. "It must end with</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3655">Svidrigaïloff, he thought, and at all costs to get through this business as quickly as possible; besides, he seemed to be expecting my visit. " At that moment such a hatred suddenly overflowed his heart that, if he had been able to kill either of these two detested beings: Svidrigaïloff or Porphyre, he would probably not have hesitated to do so.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3656">But he had hardly opened the door when he found himself face to face in the vestibule with Porfiry himself. The examining magistrate had come to see him. At first Raskolnikov was astounded, but he recovered himself almost at once. Strange to say, this visit did not surprise him very much, and he was not even very much frightened. "Perhaps it is the end!" he thought, "but why did he soften his footsteps? I didn't hear him come in. Perhaps he was listening at the door?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3657">"You didn't expect my visit, Rodion Romanovitch!" said Porfiry Petrovich gaily. "I had long intended to come and see you, and, passing your house, I thought I would say a word or two. You were just going out, I see. I won't detain you. Five minutes only, the time to smoke a cigarette, if you will allow me."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3658">"But sit down, Porfiry Petrovitch, sit down," said Raskolnikov, offering his visitor a chair in such a friendly and affable manner that he himself would have been surprised if he could have seen himself. All trace of his previous impressions had vanished. Thus sometimes a man who has been struggling with a robber for half an hour, and has been in mortal terror, feels no fear at all when he feels the knife at his throat.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3659">The young man sat down opposite Porphyry and fixed him with a steady gaze. The examining magistrate blinked and began by lighting a cigarette.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3660">"Well, speak up, speak up!" Raskolnikov shouted mentally.</p>
