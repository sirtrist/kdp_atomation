<h2 class="calibre7" id="h23">III</h2>

<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p168">This sofa, which occupied nearly half the room, served as a bed for Raskolnikov. The young man often lay down on it fully dressed, without sheets; he spread his old student's overcoat over him as a blanket and made a pillow of a small cushion under which he put, to raise it a little, all his clean or dirty linen. A small table was placed in front of the sofa.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p169">Raskolnikoff's misanthropy was very well suited to the filth that reigned in this hovel. He had taken a dislike to every human face, to the point that the sight of the maid who was in charge of cleaning the rooms caused him a sort of exasperation. This is what happens to certain monomaniacs preoccupied with a fixed idea.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p170">For fifteen days, the landlady had cut off her boarder's food, and he had not yet thought to go and explain himself to her.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p171">As for Nastasia, the cook and the only servant in the house, she was not too upset to see her tenant in this state of mind, because it resulted in less work for her: she had completely stopped tidying and dusting Raskolnikov's apartment: at most she came once a week to sweep his apartment. At this moment she woke him up.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p172">"Get up," she cried, "what are you doing sleeping like that? It's nine o'clock. I've brought you some tea. Would you like a cup? You look like you've been dug up!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p173">The lodger opened his eyes, shook himself, and recognized Nastasia.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p174">"Is it the landlady who is sending me this tea?" he asked, while he made a painful effort to sit up.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p175">"No danger of that being her!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p176">The maid placed her own teapot, which still contained some tea, in front of him, and put two small yellow sugar lumps on the table.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p177">"Nastasia, take this, please," said Raskolnikov, fumbling in his pocket, from which he pulled out a handful of small change (this time again he had gone to bed fully dressed), "and go and get me a small white loaf. You can also go to the butcher's and buy me some sausage, cheap."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p178">"In a minute I will bring you the white bread, but instead of the sausage, would you not like some chtchi? We made some yesterday, it is very good. I had already kept a portion for you yesterday evening, but you came home so late! It is very good."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p179">She went to fetch the soup, and when Raskolnikov began to eat, she sat down on the sofa beside him and began to chatter like a real country girl.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p180">"Praskovia Pavlovna wants to complain to the police about you," she said.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p181">The young man's face darkened.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p182">— To the police? Why?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p183">— You don't pay her, and you don't want to leave. That's why.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p184">"Ah! devil! this is the last straw!" he muttered between his teeth; "this is very ill-timed for me. She is a fool," he added aloud; "I will go and see her to-day, and speak to her."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p185">— As for being stupid, she is just as stupid as I am; but you, who are intelligent, why do you lie there like a good-for-nothing? Why do we never see any of your money? It seems that in the past you used to give lessons, why don't you do anything now?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p186">"I am doing something," answered Raskolnikov, dryly and as though against his will.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p187">— What are you doing?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p188">— A job…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p189">— What work?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p190">"I think," he replied seriously, after a silence.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p191">Nastasia twisted herself about. She was of a gay disposition; but when she laughed, it was a silent laugh that shook her whole person and ended by making her feel ill.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p192">“Does thinking bring in much money?” she asked when she could speak.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p193">— One cannot go and give lessons when one has no boots. Besides, I spit on it.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p194">— Beware that your spittle does not fall back on your face.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p195">"What can one do with a few kopecks?" he continued, in a tone of bitterness, addressing himself rather to himself than to his interlocutor.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p196">— You would like to acquire a fortune all at once?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p197">He looked at her with a strange expression and remained silent for a moment.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p198">"Yes, a fortune," he said afterwards with emphasis.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p199">— Gently, you frighten me; you are so terrible! Shall I go and get you a little white roll?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p200">— As you wish.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p201">“Oh, I forgot! A letter came for you while you were out.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p202">— A letter! for me? from whom?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p203">— From whom, I don't know. I gave the postman three kopecks out of my own pocket. I did the right thing, didn't I?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p204">“Bring it, for God's sake! Bring it!” cried Raskolnikov, in great agitation. “Lord!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p205">A minute later, the letter was in his hands. He had not been mistaken: it was from his mother and bore the stamp of the government of R… He could not help but turn pale on receiving it. He had been without news of his family for a long time; however, at that moment, something else suddenly gripped his heart.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p206">“Nastasia, go away, please! Here are your three kopecks, but for God's sake, go away quickly!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p207">The letter trembled in his fingers; he did not want to open it in Nastasia's presence, and he waited until the servant had left before beginning to read it. Alone, he quickly brought the envelope to his lips and kissed it. Then he began to examine the address at length; he recognized the characters traced by a beloved hand: it was the fine and slightly slanting handwriting of his mother, who had once taught him to read and write. He hesitated, even seemed to experience a certain fear. Finally, he broke the seal: the letter was very long; two large sheets of postal paper had been filled on both sides.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p208">"My dear Rodia," wrote the mother, "it is more than two months since I have written to you, and I have suffered so much from my silence that I have often been unable to sleep. But you will forgive me my involuntary silence. You know how I love you; Dounia and I have only you, you are everything to us, our only hope, our only happiness in the future. What became of me when I heard that you had been obliged to leave the university for want of means to live, and that you had no lessons and no resources of any kind!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p209">"How could I help you with my annual pension of one hundred and twenty roubles? The fifteen roubles I sent you four months ago, as you know yourself, I borrowed from a merchant in our town, Afanasy Ivanovitch Vakhrouchine. He is a good man, and he was your father's friend. But having given him power of attorney to receive my pension for me, I could not send you anything until he was repaid, and he has only just been repaid.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p210">« Now, thank God, I think I can send you some more money. Besides, I hasten to tell you that we have now reason to be grateful to fortune. First of all, a thing of which you probably have no idea, dear Rodya, is that your sister has been living with me for six weeks already, and she will not leave me now. God be praised! Her sufferings are over; but let us go in order, for I want you to know how it all happened and what we have concealed from you till now.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p211">"Two months ago you wrote to me that you had heard of the sad situation in which Dounia was living in the Svidrigaïlov family, and you asked me for some explanation of it. What could I tell you then? If I had told you the facts, you would have left everything and come to us, even if you had to walk the whole way; for, with the character and feelings I know you to have, you would not have allowed your sister to be insulted. I was in despair myself, but what could I do? I did not know the whole truth myself then. The worst of it was that Dounia, who had entered that house last year as a governess, had received a hundred roubles in advance, which she was to repay by monthly deductions from her salary; so she had to stay there until her debt was paid off.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p212">"This sum (today I can explain everything to you, my dear Rodia), she had borrowed mainly to send you the sixty roubles you needed so badly and which you received from us last year. At that time, we deceived you by writing that this money came from old savings accumulated by Dounia. It was a lie; now I am revealing the whole truth to you, because God has allowed things to take a sudden turn for the better, and also so that you know how much Dounia loves you and what a golden heart she has.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p213">"The fact is that Mr. Svidrigailov began by being very rude to her; at table he never ceased to shower her with rudeness and sarcasms... But why should I go into these painful details which would only irritate you unnecessarily, since all that is past? In short, though treated with much respect and kindness by Marfa Petrovna, Svidrigailov's wife, and by the other persons in the house, Dounia had a great deal to put up with, especially when Mr. Svidrigailov, who had been in the habit of drinking heavily while in the regiment, was in his cups. And if all this had been no more than rudeness and contempt, I should not have mentioned it at all; but imagine, under the guise of rudeness and contempt, this imbecile concealed a passion for Dounia!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p214">"At last he threw off the mask, that is, he made Dounia dishonorable proposals, tried to seduce her with various promises, declaring himself ready to abandon his family and go abroad with her either to another village or to a foreign country. You can imagine all Dounia's sufferings. Not only did the question of money, of which I have spoken to you, prevent her from resigning her post immediately, but she was also afraid, in doing so, of awakening the suspicions of Marfa Petrovna and of causing trouble in the family.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p215">« The denouement came unexpectedly. Marfa Petrovna unexpectedly surprised her husband in the garden at the moment when he was pestering Dounia with his entreaties, and, not understanding the situation, she attributed all the blame to the poor girl. A terrible scene took place between them. Madame Svidrigailov would not listen to anything; she shouted for an hour against her supposed rival, even went so far as to strike her, and finally had her brought back to me in a simple peasant cart, without even giving her time to pack her trunk.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p216">"All Dounia's things, linen, dresses, etc., were thrown into the sledge in a heap. The rain was pouring in torrents, and, after all these insults, Dounia had to drive seventeen versts with a peasant in an open cart. Tell me now, what could I write to you in reply to your letter received two months ago? I was in despair; I dared not tell you the truth, because it would have caused you too much grief and irritation; besides, Dounia had forbidden me. As for writing to fill my letter with trifles, I felt incapable of doing so, with my heart so full. After this affair, we were the talk of the town for a long month, and things came to such a pass that Dounia and I could not go to church without hearing people whisper contemptuously as we passed.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p217">"All this is due to Marfa Petrovna, who lost no time in going about and slandering Dounia. She knows everyone in our town, and she has been here almost every day. She is a great gossip, and she loves to complain to everyone about her husband. She soon spread the story not only in the town, but all over the district. My health gave way; Dounia was stronger than I. She did not give way to hysterics, she was not afraid of the slander; she was the first to encourage me, and she kept up my spirits. If you had seen her at that time! She is an angel!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p218">"But Divine mercy put an end to our misfortunes. Mr. Svidrigailov came to his senses, and, probably taking pity on the fate of the young girl he had compromised, he placed before Marfa Petrovna the most convincing proofs of Dounia's innocence.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p219">“He had kept a letter which she had been forced to write to him before the scene in the garden, declining an invitation to meet him. In this letter, she reproached him for his unworthy conduct towards his wife, reminded him of his duties as a father and a husband, and finally, pointed out the baseness of persecuting a young girl who was unhappy and defenseless.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p220">« From that moment, Marfa Petrovna had no doubt of Dounia's innocence. The next day, which was a Sunday, she came to our house, and after telling us everything, she threw herself into Dounia's arms, and weeping, begged her pardon. Then she went to all the houses in the town, and everywhere paid the most glowing tribute to Dounia's honesty, and to the nobility of her feelings and conduct. Not content with this, she showed and read to everyone Dounia's autograph letter to Mr. Svidrigaïlov; she even had copies made of it (which I think was unnecessary). At least, she completely rehabilitated Dounia; but her husband came out of the affair with an indelible stain on his reputation; I cannot even help pitying the poor fool, so severely punished.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p221">"Dounia received offers of lessons in various houses at once; but she refused them. Everyone, in general, suddenly began to show her a special consideration, and the return of public esteem was the main cause of the unexpected event which, I may say, is going to change our destiny.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p222">"Learn, dear Rodya, that a match has been proposed for your sister, and that she has already given her consent, which I hasten to inform you of. You will forgive Dounia and me for having taken this decision without consulting you, when you know that the matter could not be postponed and that it was impossible for us to wait, in order to give our answer, until we had received yours. Besides, not being on the spot, you could not have judged in the matter with full knowledge of the facts.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p223">"Here is how it happened. The future husband, Pierre Petrovitch Loujine, is a court councillor, a distant relative of Marfa Petrovna, who played a very important part in this affair. It was she who introduced him to us. He was received in a proper manner, took coffee, and the very next day sent us a very polite letter, in which he asked for my hand, requesting a prompt and categorical answer. This gentleman is a very busy man of affairs; he is on the point of going to Petersburg, so that he has not a minute to lose.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p224">"Naturally, we were at first stupefied, so little did we expect such a brusque demand. Your sister and I examined the question together all day. Pierre Petrovitch is in a fine position; he serves in two places and already possesses a fortune. To be sure, he is forty-five years old, but his exterior is quite pleasant, and he can still please women. He is a very well-poised and very proper man, I find him only a little cold and haughty; however, appearances may be deceptive.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p225">"You are warned, dear Rodia: when you see him in Petersburg, which will not be long, do not judge him too quickly and do not condemn him without appeal, as you are used to doing, if, at first sight, you feel little sympathy for him. I say this to you at random: in the end, I am convinced that he will make a favorable impression on you. Besides, in general, to know someone, you have to have practiced him for a long time and observed him carefully; otherwise, you make errors of judgment that are very difficult to correct later.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p226">"But as for Pierre Petrovitch, everything leads us to believe that he is a very respectable man. On his first visit, he declared to us that he was a positive man: "However," he added in his own words, "I share in many respects the ideas of our modern generations, and I am the enemy of all prejudices." He said a great deal more, for he seems to be a little vain and a phrase-maker, which, after all, is not a hanging matter.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p227">“I, of course, did not understand much of what he said, so I will limit myself to quoting Dounia's opinion: ‘Although he is poorly educated,' she said to me, ‘he is intelligent and seems good.' You know your sister's character, Rodia. She is a courageous, sensible, patient, and magnanimous girl, although she has a passionate heart, as I have been able to see. Certainly this is not a marriage of love for either of them; but Dounia is not only an intelligent girl, she is also a creature of angelic nobility, and if her husband makes an effort to make her happy, she will make it her duty to repay him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p228">"As a wise man, Pyotr Petrovich must understand that the happiness of his wife will be the best guarantee of his own; For example, he first gave me the impression of being a little stiff, but this is probably due to the fact that he is straightforward. Thus, on his second visit, when his request had already been granted, he told us in conversation that even before he knew Dounia he was determined to marry only an honest young girl, but without a dowry and having already experienced poverty: according to him, in fact, man should have no obligation to his wife, and it is much better that she sees in her husband a benefactor.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p229">"These are not quite the words he used, I must admit that he expressed himself in a more delicate manner, but I only remember the idea. Besides, he said it without premeditation; obviously the phrase escaped him in the heat of the conversation; he even tried afterwards to attenuate its scope. Nevertheless, I found it somewhat stiff, and I later made the observation to Dounia. But she answered me with humor that words are only words, which, after all, is true. During the night that preceded her determination, Dounetchka did not close her eyes. Believing me asleep, she left the bed to walk up and down the room. Finally, she got down on her knees, and, after a long and fervent prayer before the image, she told me the next morning that her resolution was made.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p230">"I have already told you that Pyotr Petrovitch is going to Petersburg soon. He has important business there, and he wants to establish himself as an advocate in that city. He has been studying law for some time; he has just won an important case, and his trip to Petersburg is motivated by a major case he must follow in the Senate. Under these circumstances, dear Rodia, he is in a position to do you the greatest service, and Dounia and I have already thought that you could begin your future career under his auspices. Ah! if that were to happen! The advantage would be such for you that it would have to be attributed to a marked favor of divine Providence.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p231">“Dounia has nothing else in her head. We have already touched on the question with Pyotr Petrovich. He expressed himself with reserve: ‘Of course,' he said, ‘as I need a secretary, I would rather entrust this position to a relative than to a stranger, provided he is capable of filling it (it would be the last straw if you were incapable of it!); he seems to fear only that with your university work you will not have time to take care of his office. For this time, the conversation ended there, but Dounia now has only this idea in her mind. Her heated imagination already sees you working under the direction of Pyotr Petrovich and even associated with his affairs, all the more so since you are in the law faculty. As for me, Rodia, I think exactly like her, and the projects she forms for your future seem to me very realizable.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p232">"Despite the evasive answer of Peter Petrovich, which is very understandable, since he does not know you yet, Dounia firmly counts on her legitimate influence as a wife to arrange things to the liking of our common desires. Of course, we have not been careful to let Peter Petrovich know that you could one day become his partner. He is a positive man, and he would probably have taken a dim view of what would have seemed to him to be a simple dream.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p233">“Do you know something, my dear Rodya? For certain reasons, which, by the way, have nothing to do with Pyotr Petrovich and are perhaps only old-womanish whims, I think that after the wedding I will do well to continue living at my place, instead of going to live with them. He will, I am sure, be sufficiently grateful and delicate to ask me not to separate from my daughter; if he has not said anything about it up to now, it is, of course, understood. But I intend to refuse.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p234">"If possible, I will settle in your neighborhood, for, Rodia, I have saved the best for last. Learn, therefore, my dear friend, that very soon we will see each other again, and that we will be given to kiss each other again after being separated for nearly three years! It is already decided that Dounia and I will go to Petersburg. When? I do not know exactly; but, in any case, it will be soon, perhaps in eight days. Everything is subject to the arrangements of Pyotr Petrovich, who will send us his instructions as soon as he has organized himself there. He wants, for certain reasons, to hasten the wedding ceremony as much as possible: if possible, he wishes the marriage to be celebrated during these days of carnival or, at the latest, after the Assumption fast. Oh! with what joy I will press you to my heart!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p235">"Dunia is very excited at the thought of seeing you again, and she once said to me in jest that, if only for that reason, she would willingly marry Pyotr Petrovich. She is an angel! She adds nothing to my letter, because she would have, she says, too many things to tell you, and that in such a case, it is not worth writing a few lines; she charges me with a thousand kisses for you. Although we are on the eve of being reunited, I still intend to send you as much money as I can as soon as possible. As soon as it became known here that Dounia was going to marry Pyotr Petrovich, my credit suddenly improved, and I know for a fact that Afanasy Ivanovich is quite ready to advance me up to seventy roubles, repayable on my pension.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p236">"I shall therefore send you twenty-five or thirty roubles within a few days. I should even send you a larger sum, if I did not fear being short of money for the journey. It is true that Pierre Petrovitch has the kindness to take upon himself a part of our travelling expenses; he is to provide us, at his own expense, with a large trunk to pack our things in; but we must pay our coupons to Petersburg, and we cannot arrive in the capital without a penny in our pockets.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p237">"Dounia and I have already calculated everything: the trip will not cost us much. From our house to the railway there are only ninety versts, and we have arranged with a peasant we know to take us in his cart to the station; then we shall take great pleasure in getting into a third-class compartment. In short, after all is said and done, it is thirty roubles and not twenty-five that I shall have the pleasure of sending you.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p238">"Now, my dear Rodia, I kiss you in anticipation of our next meeting, and I send you my maternal blessing. Love your sister Dounia, Rodia; know that she loves you infinitely more than herself, and pay her back in return. She is an angel, and you, Rodia, are everything to us, all our hope, all our future happiness. As long as you are happy, we will be happy too. Goodbye! or rather<i class="calibre4">Goodbye.</i>! I kiss you a thousand times.</p>

<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p240">Tears often moistened the young man's eyes during the reading of this letter; but, when he had finished it, a spiteful smile appeared on his pale and convulsed face. Resting his head on his foul and dirty pillow, he remained for a long time lost in thought. His heart beat strongly, and confusion reigned in his ideas. At last, he felt cramped, as if suffocated in this little yellow room that resembled a cupboard or a trunk. His physical and moral being needed space.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p241">He put on his hat and went out, not fearing this time to meet anyone on the stairs. He no longer thought of the landlady. He went towards Vasili Ostroff by the V. Prospect. His walk was rapid, like that of a man who is going to some urgent business; but, as usual, he noticed nothing on the way, muttered to himself, and even talked aloud, which greatly astonished the passers-by. Many took him for a drunken man.</p>
