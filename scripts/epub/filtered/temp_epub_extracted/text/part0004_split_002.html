<h2 class="calibre7" id="h216">II</h2>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1676">The next morning, after seven o'clock, Razumikhin woke up with worries that had never troubled his existence before. He recalled all the incidents of the evening and realized that he had experienced an impression very different from any he had previously experienced. He felt at the same time that the dream that had crossed his mind was completely unrealizable. This chimera even seemed so absurd to him that he was ashamed to think about it. So he hurried to pass on to other questions, more practical ones, which the cursed day before had in a sense bequeathed to him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1677">What he regretted most was that he had shown himself to be a “boor” the day before. Not only had he been seen drunk, but, taking advantage of the position of benefactor that he occupied with regard to a young girl who was forced to turn to him, he had insulted the young girl's fiancé out of a feeling of stupid and sudden jealousy, without knowing what relations existed between them, or even what this gentleman was like. What right had he to judge Pyotr Petrovich so rashly? And who had asked for his opinion? Besides, could a creature such as Avdotia Romanovna marry for money a man unworthy of her? So Pyotr Petrovich must have some merit. There was the question of the lodging, but how could he know what that house was like? Besides, these ladies were only there temporarily, another dwelling was being prepared for them… Oh! how miserable all this was! And could he justify himself by saying that he was drunk? That stupid excuse only made him seem more despicable! The truth is in wine, and under the influence of wine he had revealed the whole truth, that is, the baseness of a coarsely jealous heart! Was such a dream in the least permissible to him, to Razumikhin? What was he, compared to this young girl, he, the boastful and brutal drunkard of the day before? What could be more odious and ridiculous at the same time than the idea of a rapprochement between two beings so dissimilar?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1678">The young man, already ashamed of such a mad thought, suddenly remembered that the day before, on the staircase, he had said that the landlady loved him and would be jealous of Avdotia Romanovna. This recollection came just in time to add to his confusion. It was too much: he struck a heavy blow with his fist on the kitchen stove, hurt his hand, and broke a brick.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1679">"No doubt," he muttered after a minute, with a feeling of profound humiliation, "no doubt, now it is done, there is no way to erase all these turpitudes ... It is therefore useless to think about it; I will present myself without saying anything, I will silently fulfill my task and ... I will not make any excuses, I will say nothing ... Now it is too late, the damage is done! "</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1680">However, he took particular care of his appearance. He had only one suit, and even if he had owned several, he might have kept the one from the night before "so as not to look as if he had made himself up on purpose ..." However, a cynical slovenliness would have been in the worst taste; he had no right to hurt the feelings of others, especially since, in this case, it was people who needed him and had themselves asked him to come and see them. Consequently, he brushed his clothes carefully. As for linen, Razumikhin could only tolerate clean linen on his person.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1681">Having found soap at Nastasia's, he conscientiously performed his ablutions, washing his hair, neck, and especially his hands. When the moment came to decide whether to shave (Praskovya Pavlovna had excellent razors, a legacy from her late husband, Mr. Zarnitsyn), he decided the question negatively and even with a kind of irritated brusqueness: “No,” he said to himself, “I'll stay as I am! They might think that I shaved for . . . Never in my life!” These monologues were interrupted by the arrival of Zosimov. After spending the night at Praskovya Pavlovna's apartment, the doctor had gone home for a moment and was now returning to visit the patient. Razumikhin told him that Raskolnikov was sleeping like a log. Zosimov forbade him to be awakened and promised to return between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1682">Provided, however, that he is at home, he added.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1683">— With a client so prone to running away, we can't count on anything! Do you know if he's supposed to go to their place, or if they'll come here?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1684">I presume they will come," replied Razumihin, understanding why the question was put to him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1685">— They will, no doubt, have to talk over their family affairs. I will go. You, in your capacity of physician, have, naturally, more rights than I.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1686">— I am not a confessor; besides, I have other things to do than to listen to their secrets; I shall go too.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1687">"One thing worries me," Razumihin continued, frowning.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1688">— Yesterday, I was drunk, and while I was taking Rodion back here, I couldn't hold my tongue: among other stupidities, I told him that you feared in him a predisposition to madness…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1689">“You said the same thing to the ladies yesterday.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1690">"I know I've done a foolish thing! Beat me if you like! But, between ourselves, sincerely, what is your opinion of her?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1691">"What do you want me to say? You yourself described him to me as a monomaniac when you brought me to him... And yesterday we disturbed his mind even more; I say we, but it was you who did it with your stories about the painter; that's a fine conversation to have with a man whose mental disorder may have come from this affair! If I had known then in all its details the scene that took place at the police station, if I had known that he had seen himself there as the object of the suspicions of a scoundrel, I would have stopped you yesterday at the first word. These monomaniacs make an ocean out of a drop of water, the nonsense of their imagination appears to them as realities... Half of the thing is now explained to me by what Zametoff told us at your party. By the way, this Zametoff is a charming boy, only, hum... he was wrong yesterday to say all that. He's a terrible chatterbox!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1692">— But to whom did he tell this story? To you and to me.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1693">— And to Porphyre.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1694">"Well, what does it matter if he told Porphyre that?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1695">— While I think of it: do you have any influence over the mother and sister? They had better be circumspect with him today…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1696">"I will tell them," answered Razumihin, with a dissatisfied air.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1697">"Good-bye," he said. "Thank Praskovya Pavlovna for her hospitality. She has shut herself up in her room; I called to her through the door, 'Good-morning!' but she did not answer. She has been up since seven o'clock, though; I saw her samovar being carried from the kitchen into her room. She did not condescend to see me."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1698">At nine o'clock precisely, Razumihin arrived at the Bakaleyevs' house. The two ladies had been waiting for him for a long time with feverish impatience. They had got up before seven o'clock. He entered gloomy and sullen, and at once began complaining to Pulcheria Alexandrovna that he had been kept waiting so long. He had been waiting for her for the last three hours. He had come on foot, and had been knocking at the door for the last hour and a half. But she had not come down even then. He had written her and his sister a note that he would come and see them at nine o'clock, and they had promised to wait for him. But now it was past nine, and they had not come down. He was unpardonably late, and Pulcheria Alexandrovna was very angry with him. She was waiting for him with a certain feeling of triumph, and she was not in the least embarrassed by his sullenness. She was doubly delighted to see that he was sullen and not cheerful. She was convinced that he was so because he was ashamed of his behavior the day before, and was trying to atone for it. She thought that he was very much ashamed, and that made her happy. At last, at nine o'clock, Razumihin came in. He was wearing a very shabby coat, and his hands were dirty and his face was red. He was unshaven, and his hair was ruffled. He had a very strange expression in his eyes. He was greatly agitated, too. He had evidently had a great deal to drink that day. He was very unceremonious with Pulcheria Alexandrovna. He called her "Pulcheria Alexandrovna," and did not once address her by her Christian name. He sat down at the table without asking permission, and without even apologizing for his lateness. He simply said, "Good morning," and looked at Avdotia Romanovna with a smile, which was not a smile at all, but a kind of spasmodic twitch.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1699">On hearing that her son was still asleep, but that there was nothing to be anxious about, Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared that it was all for the best, because she had much to talk over with Razumihin before seeing her son. The mother and daughter then asked the visitor to have some tea with them, and, on his declining, they had a cup together, and then they all sat down to table.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1700">Avdotia Romanovna rang the bell; a ragged servant appeared at the summons, and was ordered to bring tea, which was finally served, but in such a way that the two ladies were quite ashamed. Razumihin cursed the "box" vigorously, and then, thinking of Luzhin, became silent, lost his countenance, and was glad to be relieved by Pulcheria Alexandrovna's questions, which were put in a straightforward and businesslike manner.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1701">Questioned at every instant, he spoke for three quarters of an hour and told all he knew concerning the principal facts which had filled the life of Rodion Romanovitch during the past year. He ended by the circumstantial account of his friend's illness. As a matter of course, he passed over in silence what ought not to have been mentioned; for instance, the scene at the police station, and all the rest of it. The two ladies listened eagerly, and when he thought he had told them everything that could possibly interest them, their curiosity was still unsatisfied.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1702">"Tell me, tell me, what do you think… ah! pardon! I don't know your name yet?" said Pulcheria Alexandrovna quickly.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1703">— Dmitri Prokofitch.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1704">"Well, Dmitri Prokofitch, I should like to know… how, in general… he now looks at things, or, to put it more clearly, what he likes and what he does not like. Is he still so irritable? What are his desires, his dreams, if you will? Under what particular influence is he at the moment?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1705">"What can I tell you? I have known Rodion for eighteen months. He is morose, gloomy, proud, and haughty. Of late (but perhaps this disposition existed in him long ago), he has become suspicious and hypochondriac. He is good and generous. He does not like to reveal his feelings, and he would rather hurt people than be expansive. Sometimes, however, he is not at all hypochondriac, but only cold and insensitive to the point of inhumanity. It really seems as if there are two opposite characters in him, which manifest themselves in turn. At certain moments, he is extremely taciturn. Everything is a burden to him, everyone annoys him, and he lies in bed doing nothing! He is not a mocker, not because his wit lacks causticity, but rather because he disdains persiflage as a pastime too frivolous. He does not listen to everything that is said to him to the end. He never takes an interest in things that, at a given moment, interest everyone. He has a very high opinion of himself, and I believe that in this he is not entirely wrong. What more can I say? It seems to me that your arrival will have a most salutary effect on him."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1706">"Ah, God grant it!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, greatly disturbed by these revelations about her Rodya's character.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1707">At last, Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at Avdotya Romanovna. While he was speaking, he had often glanced at her, but in a sidelong way, and without turning his head. The young girl sat down near the table and listened attentively, sometimes she got up, and, as was her habit, walked about the room, her arms folded, her lips compressed, and making from time to time a brief inquiry, without stopping in her walk. She had a habit of not listening to the end of what was said. She wore a dress of dark, thin material and had a white kerchief round her neck. Razumihin soon detected that the two women were very poor. If Avdotya Romanovna had been dressed like a queen, he would probably not have been so much struck by her beauty. Now, however, he felt a great deal of respect for her, and felt ashamed of his own timidity. He observed her every movement and gesture, and was extremely anxious to make a favourable impression.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1708">You have given many curious details about my brother's character, and... you have given them impartially. That's good; I thought you were in admiration of him, observed Avdotia Romanovna with a smile.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1709">"I think there must be a woman in his life," she added, dreamily.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1710">“I didn't say that, but you may be right, only…”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1711">— What?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1712">"He loves no one; perhaps he will never love anyone," Razumihin continued.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1713">— That is to say, he is incapable of loving?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1714">"But do you know, Avdotia Romanovna, that you yourself are terribly like your brother, I would even say in all respects!" the young man blurted out in confusion. Then he suddenly remembered the judgment he had just passed on Raskolnikov, became flustered, and turned red as a lobster. Avdotia Romanovna could not help smiling as she looked at him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1715">You may both be mistaken about Rodya, Pulcheria Alexandrovna remarked, a little piqued.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1716">"I am not speaking of the present, Dounia. What Peter Petrovich writes in this letter... and what we have supposed, you and I, may not be true, but you cannot imagine, Dmitri Prokofitch, how capricious and fantastic he is. Even when he was only fifteen, his character was a continual surprise to me. Even now, I believe he is capable of doing some such mad thing that no other man would think of... Without going further, do you know that eighteen months ago he nearly caused my death, when he took it into his head to marry that... that lady Zarnitsyn, his landlady's daughter?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1717">"Do you know the details of this story?" asked Avdotya Romanovna.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1718">"You think," continued the mother with animation, "that he would have paid any attention to my supplications, to my tears, that my illness, the fear of seeing me die, our misery would have touched him? No, he would have gone on with his plan as calmly as possible, without letting himself be stopped by any consideration. And yet, is it possible that he does not love us?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1719">"He never said anything to me about it," answered Razumihin with reserve, "but I have heard something of it from Mrs. Zarnitsyn, who is not very talkative either, and what I have heard is rather strange."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1720">"Well, what have you learned?" asked the two women in unison.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1721">"Oh! nothing particularly interesting, to tell the truth! All I know is that this marriage, which was already a settled affair and was going to take place when the bride died, was extremely displeasing to Madame Zarnitzine herself... On the other hand, it is said that the young girl was not beautiful, or, to put it better, that she was ugly; moreover, she was said to be very sickly and... strange. However, it appears that she had certain qualities. She must, of course, have had them: otherwise it would be impossible to understand..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1722">"I am convinced that that young girl had merit," observed Avdotia Romanovna laconically.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1723">"God forgive me, but I rejoiced at his death, and yet I don't know which of them this marriage would have been the most fatal for," concluded the mother; then, timidly, after much hesitation, and glancing continually at Dounia, to whom this manœuver seemed to be very disagreeable, she began to question Razumihin again about the scene of the previous day between Rodya and Luzhin. This incident seemed to be worrying her above all else, and to cause her real terror. The young man again recounted in detail the altercation he had witnessed, but this time he added his own conclusion: he openly accused Raskolnikov of having deliberately insulted Pyotr Petrovich, and no longer invoked his illness to excuse his friend's conduct.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1724">"Before he was ill, he had already premeditated it," he added.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1725">"I think so too," said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, with a look of consternation. But she was very much surprised to see that this time Razumihin had spoken of Pyotr Petrovich in the most respectful terms, and even with a sort of esteem. This struck Avdotya Romanovna also.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1726">"So that is your opinion of Pierre Petrovitch?" Pulcheria Alexandrovna could not help asking.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1727">"I cannot have any other opinion of the future husband of your daughter," replied Razumihin in a firm and hearty tone, and it was not mere politeness that made him speak thus; "I say this because… because… well, it is enough that the man is the one whom Avdotia Romanovna herself has freely chosen. If yesterday I expressed myself in insulting terms about him, it was because yesterday I was abominably drunk, and, besides… mad; yes, mad, I had lost my head, I was completely crazy… and today I am ashamed of it!…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1728">He blushed and was silent. Avdotia Romanovna's cheeks also flushed, but she remained silent. Since the subject of Luzhin had been introduced, she had not uttered a word.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1729">However, deprived of the help of her daughter, Pulcheria Alexandrovna was in a visible embarrassment. At last she took the floor with an hesitating voice, and, raising her eyes every moment to Dounia, she said that at that moment a circumstance was troubling her to the utmost.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1730">"You see, Dmitri Prokofitch," she began. "I shall be quite frank with Dmitri Prokofitch, Dounia?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1731">“Of course, mother,” answered Avdotia Romanovna in a tone of authority.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1732">"Here is what it is," said the mother, hastening to speak, as if a mountain had been lifted from her breast by the permission to communicate her sorrow.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1733">“This morning, at the first hour, we received a letter from Pyotr Petrovich in response to the one we wrote him yesterday to inform him of our arrival. You see, he was supposed to come yesterday to pick us up at the station, as he had promised. In his place, we found, at the railway station, a servant who brought us here and announced for this morning the visit of his master. Now, instead of coming, Pyotr Petrovich sent us this note… It is best that you read it yourself; there is a point there that worries me very much… You will see for yourself immediately what this point is… and you will tell me frankly your opinion, Dmitri Prokofitch! You know better than anyone the character of Rodia, and better than anyone you can advise us. I warn you that Dounia has, at first glance, decided the question; but I do not yet know what course to take, and… I was still waiting for you.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1734">Razumikhin unfolded the letter, dated the day before, and read the following:</p>
<div class="block-rw2" id="extract3">
<p class="calibre8" id="p1735">"Madame Pulcheria Alexandrovna, I have the honor to inform you that unforeseen circumstances prevented me from meeting you at the railway station, and I therefore sent a reliable man in my place. My business at the Senate will also prevent me from having the honor of seeing you tomorrow morning; besides, I do not wish to disturb your maternal interview with your son, or Avdotia Romanovna's with her brother. It is therefore only at eight o'clock in the evening that I shall have the honor of calling upon you at your lodgings. I beg you to excuse Rodion Romanovitch's presence at this interview, for he has insulted me in the most cruel way, while I was visiting him yesterday in his illness. Besides, I wish to have a personal explanation with you on a point of great importance to us both, of which I cannot speak now. I have the honor to inform you beforehand that if, contrary to my desire, I find Rodion Romanovitch with you, I shall be obliged to withdraw immediately, and then you have only yourself to blame.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1736">« I write this to you, having reason to believe that Rodion Romanovitch, who seemed so ill when I visited him, suddenly recovered his health two hours later and can therefore go to see you. Yesterday, in fact, I saw him with my own eyes in the apartment of a drunkard who had just been run over by a carriage; under the pretext of paying for the funeral, he gave twenty-five rubles to the daughter of the deceased, a young woman of notorious misconduct. This surprised me greatly, because I know at what price you had obtained this sum. On this, I beg you to convey my eager homage to the honorable Avdotia Komanovna, and to allow me to say to you, with respectful devotion,</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1737">« Your obedient servant,</p>
<p class="attribution-rw" id="attribution2"> <span class="smallcaps-rw">P. Loujine. »</span> </p>
</div>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1738">"What shall I do now, Dmitri Prokofitch?" Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked, almost in tears. "How can I tell Rodya not to come? Yesterday he insisted so strongly that Pyotr Petrovitch should be sent for, and now I'm told that he is forbidden to come! But he will come on purpose if he knows, and... what will happen then?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1739">“Follow the advice of Avdotia Romanovna,” answered Razumihin calmly and without the slightest hesitation.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1740">"Ah, my God, she says... God knows what she says, she doesn't explain her purpose to me! According to her, it is better or rather absolutely essential that Rodia come this evening at eight o'clock and that he meet here with Pyotr Petrovich... I would rather not show him the letter and use address to prevent him from coming, I counted on succeeding with your help... I also do not see what dead drunkard and what girl can be mentioned in this note; I cannot understand that he gave this person his last coins... who...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1741">— Which represent so many sacrifices for you, mother, added the young girl.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1742">"He was not in his normal state yesterday," said Razumihin thoughtfully. "If you knew what he did yesterday in a tavern; but, of course, he did quite right, hum! He talked to me yesterday about a dead man and a young girl, while I was taking him home, but I didn't understand a word of it… It's true I was drunk myself yesterday…"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1743">“The best thing, mother, is to go to his place, and there, I assure you, we shall see at once what is to be done. Besides, it is time. Lord! ten o'clock past!” cried Avdotia Romanovna, looking at a magnificent enamelled gold watch which hung on her neck by a thin Venetian chain and which contrasted strangely with the rest of her attire.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1744">"It's a present from her fiancé," thought Razumihin.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1745">Ah! it is time to go!... It is high time, Dounia! said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, all in a flurry.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1746">— He will think we are angry with him for his reception of us yesterday; that will be the explanation of our delay. Ah! my God!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1747">While she was speaking, she was hastily putting on her hat and mantle. Dounia was also preparing to go out. Her gloves were not only shabby, but torn, which Razumihin noticed; but the poverty of their attire gave the two ladies a peculiarly distinguished air, as is always the case with women who know how to wear humble clothes.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1748">"My God!" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, "would I ever have believed that I should be so afraid of a meeting with my son, with my dear Rodya!... I am afraid, Dmitri Prokofitch!" she added, glancing timidly at the young man.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1749">“Don't be afraid, mother,” said Dounia, embracing her mother, “believe in him rather. I have faith.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1750">"Ah! my God, so do I, and yet I have not slept all night," replied the poor woman.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1751">All three left the house.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1752">“Do you know, Dounia, that this morning, at daybreak, I had just fallen asleep when I saw in a dream the late Marfa Petrovna… She was all in white… Ah! my God! Dmitri Prokofitch, you don't know yet that Marfa Petrovna is dead?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1753">"No, I didn't know that; what Marfa Petrovna?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1754">"She died suddenly! And imagine..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1755">"Later, mother," Dounia interrupted. "He doesn't know yet which Marfa Petrovna it is."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1756">"Ah! you don't know her? I thought I had told you all about her. Forgive me, Dmitri Prokofitch, I've been so upset for the last two days. I look upon you as our Providence, and that's why I was so sure you knew all about our affairs. I look upon you as a relation... Don't be angry with me for saying so. Ah! my God! what's the matter with your hand? You've hurt yourself?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1757">"Yes, I hurt myself," muttered Razumihin, quite happy.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1758">"I am sometimes too expansive, and Dounia reproaches me for it. But, my God, what a hole he lives in!... If only he is awake!... And that woman, his landlady, calls that a room! Listen, you say that he does not like to open his heart; it is possible, then, that I shall bore him with my... weaknesses?... Won't you give me some advice, Dmitri Prokofitch? How ought I to behave with him? You know, I am quite at sea."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1759">“Do not question him too much, if you see that he frowns; avoid, above all, multiplying questions about his health: he does not like that.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1760">“Ah, Dmitri Prokofitch, how difficult it is sometimes to be a mother! But here is the staircase again… What a dreadful staircase!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1761">"Mother, you are pale, calm yourself, my dear," said Dounia, caressing her mother, "why torment yourself thus when it must be a happiness for him to see you?" she added with a flash in her eyes.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1762">— Wait, I'll go ahead to make sure he's awake.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1763">Razumikhin having taken the lead, the ladies followed him up the stairs very quietly. On the fourth floor they noticed that the landlady's door was ajar, and that through the narrow opening two black and piercing eyes were watching them. When their glances met, the door suddenly slammed shut with such a bang that Pulcheria Alexandrovna almost cried out in alarm.</p>
