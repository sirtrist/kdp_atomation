<h2 class="calibre7" id="h230">II</h2>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3661">"Oh, these cigarettes!" Porfiry Petrovich began at last.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3662">“It's my death, and I can't give it up! I cough, I have a beginning of irritation in my throat, and I'm asthmatic. I went to consult Botkin recently; he examines each patient for at least half an hour. After having listened to me for a long time, tapped me, etc., he said among other things: Tobacco is no good for you, you have dilated lungs. Yes, but how to give up tobacco? What to replace it with? I don't drink, that's the trouble, hee! hee! hee! Everything is relative, Rodion Romanovitch!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3663">"Here is another preamble that smells of legal cunning!" Raskolnikov muttered to himself. His recent interview with the examining magistrate suddenly came back to his mind, and at the memory anger awoke in his heart.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3664">"I was here the night before last," continued Porfiry Petrovich, looking round the room, "you didn't know that, did you?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3665">— I entered this very room. I happened to be in your street, as I am today, and the idea came to me to pay you a little visit. Your door was open, I entered, I waited for you for a moment, and then I left without leaving my name with your maid. You never lock your door?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3666">Raskolnikov's face grew darker and darker. Porfiry Petrovitch probably guessed what he was thinking.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3667">"I have come to explain myself, dear Rodion Romanovitch! I owe you an explanation," he continued with a smile, and tapping the young man lightly on the knee; but almost at the same instant his face assumed a serious, even a sad expression, to the great astonishment of Raskolnikov, to whom the examining magistrate was thus showing himself in a very unexpected light. "The last time we met, Rodion Romanovitch, there was a strange scene between us. I may have been very wrong to you, I feel. You remember how we parted: we were both very much agitated, you and I. We forgot the most elementary conventions, and yet we are gentlemen."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3668">"What is he getting at?" Raskolnikov wondered, never taking his eyes off Porfiry with anxious curiosity.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3669">I thought we would do better now to act with sincerity, said the investigating magistrate, turning his head a little and lowering his eyes as if he feared this time to disturb his former victim with his gaze:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3670">"Such scenes must not be repeated. The other day, if it had not been for Mikolka's arrival, I don't know how far things might have gone. You are naturally very irritable, Rodion Romanovitch; I had calculated on that, for when a man is irritable he is apt to let out his secret. I thought I would provoke you to anger and get some proof from you, some real evidence, something tangible, not mere psychological deductions, something that would give me grounds for hope." That was my plan. I sometimes succeed in this way, but it doesn't always work, as I have had the opportunity of seeing. I had calculated too much on your character.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3671">"But you... why are you telling me all this now?" muttered Raskolnikov, not quite realizing the question he was asking. "Is it possible that he thinks I'm innocent?" he wondered.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3672">"Why do I tell you this? But I consider it a sacred duty to explain my conduct to you. Because I have subjected you, I admit, to a cruel torture, I do not want, Rodion Romanovitch, that you should take me for a monster. I will therefore, for my justification, expose to you the antecedents of this affair. At first there were rumors of a nature and origin on which I consider it superfluous to dwell, and it is also unnecessary to tell you on what occasion your personality was mixed up in them. As for me, what aroused my suspicions was a circumstance, moreover purely accidental, of which I also have no right to speak. From these rumors and accidental circumstances the same conclusion emerged for me. I admit it frankly, for, to tell the truth, it was I who first suspected you. I leave aside the annotations attached to the objects found in the old woman's house. This clue and many others of the same kind mean nothing. Meanwhile, I had the opportunity to learn about the incident that occurred at the police station. This scene was recounted to me in the greatest detail by someone who had played the main role in it and who, without knowing it, had conducted it superbly. Well, in these conditions, how could one not turn in a certain direction? A hundred rabbits do not make a horse, a hundred presumptions do not make a proof, says the English proverb, it is reason that speaks thus, but try to fight against passions! Now, the examining magistrate is a man and therefore passionate. I also remembered then the work you published in a magazine. I had greatly enjoyed, - as an amateur, of course, - this first essay of your young pen. One could recognize a sincere conviction, an ardent enthusiasm. This article must have been written by a feverish hand during a sleepless night. "The author will not stop there!" I thought as I read it. How, I ask you, not to connect this with what followed? The slope was irresistible. Ah! Lord, am I saying anything? Am I affirming anything now? I limit myself to pointing out a reflection that came to me then. What do I think now? Nothing, that is to say, almost nothing. For the moment, I have Mikolka in my hands, and there are facts that accuse him, - say what you will, there are facts! If I reveal all this to you now, it is, I repeat, so that, judging in your heart and conscience, you will not impute my conduct of the other day to a crime. Why, you will ask me, did you not come then to search my house? I went there, hee! hee! I went there when you were here sick in bed. Not as a magistrate, not with an official character, but I came. Your apartment, from the first suspicions, was searched from top to bottom, but -<i class="calibre4">for nothing!</i>I said to myself: "Now this man will come to me, he will come himself, and very soon; if he is guilty, he cannot help coming. Another man would not come, but he will come. And you remember Mr. Razumihin's chatter? We purposely told him our conjectures in the hope that he would talk to you and put you on your guard, because we knew that Mr. Razumihin would not be able to restrain himself. Mr. Zametov was especially struck by your audacity, and, indeed, you were too reckless when you shouted to him in the tavern: "I killed her!" That was too much; it was too reckless. I was expecting you with confidence, and here you are. I was so excited at seeing you that I could hardly restrain myself. Why did you come at that moment? You came in laughing, you remember, and I thought, "Well, if he is guilty, he will laugh too." But I was wrong, I was wrong! Your laughter was genuine, you were amused, and that was a bad sign for you. Mr. Razumihin was right: you are a man of great intelligence, and you were able to deceive us all. But how did you manage it? What did you mean by that story about the stone? You were trying to tell us something, but we couldn't understand it. And then, when we talked about your article, we thought we saw a hidden meaning in every word. That's how it was, Rodion Romanovitch. Gradually I became convinced. "Of course," I thought, "all this may be explained in another way, and even more naturally, but still I would rather have some proof." But when I heard about the bell-rope, I was convinced at once. I had the proof I wanted, and I didn't want to think about anything else. At that moment I would have given a thousand roubles to have seen you walking a hundred paces with a man who had called you an assassin, without daring to answer him! Of course, one must not attach too much importance to the actions of a sick man who is in a state of delirium. But still, Rodion Romanovitch, how can you blame me for the way I treated you? And why did you come to me at that particular moment? It was the devil who brought you to me, and if it hadn't been for Mikolka... You remember Mikolka's arrival? It was like a bolt from the blue! But how did I receive him? I didn't believe a word he said, you saw that! After you left, I questioned him further, and he answered me in such a way that I was surprised myself; but still I didn't believe him, I remained as firm as a rock.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3673">“Razumikhin told me just now that you are now convinced of Mikolka's guilt, and that you yourself assured him that…”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3674">He could not finish, his breath failed him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3675">"Mr. Razumihin!" cried Porfiry Petrovich, who seemed very glad to have heard at last an observation from Raskolnikov's lips:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3676">"He! he! he!" But I wanted to get rid of Mr. Razumihin, who came to me with his tearful face, and who has nothing to do with this business. Let us leave him out of the question, if you please. As for Mikolka, do you want to know what he is, or at least what I think he is? First of all, he is like a child, he has not reached his majority. He is not exactly a coward, but he is impressionable like an artist. Don't laugh at my comparing him to an artist. He is naive, sensitive, fantastic. In his village he sings, dances, and tells stories that the peasants of the neighboring villages come to hear. He sometimes drinks himself into a stupor, not that he is a drunkard, but because he cannot resist the temptation when he is with his comrades. He does not understand that he has committed a theft by taking possession of the casket he picked up: "Since I found it on the ground," he says, "I had a right to take it." According to the people of Zaraisk, his fellow townsmen, he had a fervent devotion, spent the nights praying to God, and read the holy books constantly, "the old, true ones." Petersburg has had a bad influence on him; once here, he gave himself up to wine and women, which made him forget religion. I heard that one of our artists took an interest in him and began to give him lessons. In the meantime, this unfortunate affair happened. The poor boy was frightened and hanged himself. What can you expect? Our people cannot get rid of the idea that every man wanted by the police is a condemned man. In prison, Mikolka returned to the mysticism of his early years; now he thirsts for expiation, and it is this motive alone that has led him to confess his guilt. My conviction in this regard is based on certain facts that he himself does not know. Besides, he will eventually confess the whole truth to me. Do you think he will keep up his role to the end? Wait a little, you will see that he will retract his confession. Besides, if he has succeeded in giving his statements a semblance of truth on some points, on others, on the contrary, he is in complete contradiction with the facts, and he does not suspect it! No, batuchka Rodion Romanovitch, the guilty one is not Mikolka. We are here in the presence of a fantastic and dark affair; this crime has the mark of the contemporary, it bears the stamp of an era that makes all life consist in the search for comfort. The guilty one is a theorist, a victim of the book; he has shown a lot of audacity for his first attempt, but this audacity is of a special kind, it is that of a man who throws himself from the top of a mountain or a bell tower. He forgot to close the door behind him, and he killed, killed two people to obey a theory. He killed and he did not know how to take the money; what he could take, he went to hide under a stone. It was not enough for him to endure the anguish in the antechamber, while he heard the knocks on the door and the repeated ringing of the bell; no, yielding to an irresistible need to feel the same thrill again, he went later to visit the empty apartment and pull the bell cord. Let us put that down to illness, to half-delirium, so be it; but here is another point to note: he killed, and he still considers himself an honorable man, he despises people, he has the air of a pale angel. No, it is not Mikolka, dear Rodion Romanovitch, he is not the guilty one!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3677">This direct blow was all the more unexpected because it came after the kind of apology made by the examining magistrate. Raskolnikov trembled all over.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3678">"Then... who did... kill?" he stammered in a broken voice.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3679">The examining magistrate leaned back in his chair, in the surprise that such a question seemed to cause him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3680">"Who has killed?" he repeated, as though he could not believe his ears. "Why, you, Rodion Romanovitch, you have killed him! You are the murderer!" he added almost in a whisper, in a tone of profound conviction.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3681">Raskolnikov rose with a sudden movement, stood for a few seconds, and then sat down again without uttering a word. Slight convulsions agitated all the muscles of his face.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3682">"Your lip is trembling again, just as it did the other day," observed Porfiry Petrovich, with an air of interest. "I don't think you quite understand the object of my visit, Rodion Romanovitch," he continued after a moment's silence, "that is why you are so surprised. I came precisely to tell you all and to put the whole truth before you."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3683">"It was not I who killed him," stammered the young man, defending himself like a little child caught in a fault.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3684">"Yes, it is you, Rodion Romanovitch, you, and you alone," the magistrate replied sternly.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3685">They fell silent, and, strange to say, this silence lasted for ten minutes.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3686">Leaning against the table, Raskolnikov was rummaging in his hair. Porfiry Petrovitch waited without showing any impatience. Suddenly the young man looked with contempt at the magistrate:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3687">"You are returning to your old practices, Porfiry Petrovitch! It is always the same methods: how does it not bore you in the end?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3688">“Oh, leave my methods alone! It would be another thing if we were in the presence of witnesses, but we are talking here tête-à-tête. You see for yourself, I did not come to hunt you down and take you like game. Whether you confess or not, at this moment it is all the same to me. In either case, my conviction is made.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3689">"If that is so, why have you come?" Raskolnikov asked irritably.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3690">— I repeat the question I have already asked you: if you think I am guilty, why don't you issue a warrant for my arrest?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3691">— That's a question! I'll answer you point by point: first, your arrest would be of no use to me.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3692">— How, it would be of no use to you! Since you are convinced, you must…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3693">"What does my conviction matter? It rests on nothing but clouds, so far. And why should I put you in a position where you might be tempted to—"<i class="calibre4">at rest?</i>You know it yourself, since you ask to be put in it. I suppose that, confronted with the bourgeois, you would say to him: "Had you drunk, yes or no? Who saw me with you? I simply took you for a drunk man, which you were," - what could I reply, especially since your answer will be more plausible than his deposition, which is pure psychology, and that in addition in this case you will be right, because the funny man is known to be a drunkard? Several times already I have myself frankly admitted that all this psychology is for two purposes, and that apart from it I have nothing against you at the moment. Of course I will have you arrested, - I came to warn you, - and yet I do not hesitate to declare to you that it will not serve me in any way. The second object of my visit ...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3694">"Well, what is it?" Raskolnikov asked, panting.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3695">— … I have already told you. I wanted to explain my conduct, not wishing to appear a monster in your eyes, especially since I am one of the most favorably disposed in your favor, whether you believe it or not. In view of the interest I take in you, I frankly urge you to go and denounce yourself. I had come again to give you this advice. It is by far the most advantageous course you can take, both for you and for me, who will thus be rid of this affair. Well, am I frank enough?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3696">Raskolnikov thought for a moment.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3697">“Listen, Porfiry Petrovitch: according to your own words, you have nothing against me but psychology, and yet you aspire to mathematical evidence. Who tells you that you are not mistaken now?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3698">“No, Rodion Romanovitch, I am not mistaken. I have proof. I found this proof the other day: God sent it to me!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3699">— What is it?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3700">“I won't tell you, Rodion Romanovitch. But in any case, now I have no right to temporize; I am going to have you arrested. So judge for yourself: whatever resolution you take, it matters little to me now; everything I tell you is therefore solely in your interest. The best solution is the one I am indicating to you, be sure of that, Rodion Romanovitch!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3701">Raskolnikov smiled angrily.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3702">— Your language is more than ridiculous, it is impudent. Let's see: assuming that I am guilty (which I do not recognize at all), why would I go and denounce myself, since you yourself say that there, in prison, I will be<i class="calibre4">at rest?</i></p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3703">“Oh, Rodion Romanovitch, don't take my words too literally: you may find peace there, or you may not. I am of the opinion, of course, that prison calms the guilty, but that is only a theory, and a theory that is personal to me: now, am I an authority for you? Who knows if, at this very moment, I am not hiding something from you? You cannot demand that I reveal all my secrets, eh! eh! As for the profit you will derive from this conduct, it is indisputable. You will certainly gain by seeing your sentence significantly reduced. Think a little about the moment when you will denounce yourself: at the moment when another has assumed the crime on himself and has thrown the investigation into confusion! As for me, I take before God the formal commitment to leave you vis-à-vis the court of assizes all the benefit of your initiative. The judges will not know, I promise you, all this psychology, all these suspicions directed against you, and your démarche will have in their eyes an absolutely spontaneous character. One will see in your crime only the result of a fatal impulse, and, in essence, it is nothing else. I am an honest man, Rodion Romanovitch, and I will keep my word.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3704">Raskolnikov bowed his head and thought for a long time; at last he smiled again, but this time his smile was gentle and melancholy.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3705">"I don't care!" he said, without appearing to notice that this language almost amounted to an admission, "what do I care about the reduction in sentence you are talking about! I don't need it!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3706">“Come, this is what I feared!” exclaimed Porphyre, as if against his will; “I knew well, alas! that you would disdain our indulgence.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3707">Raskolnikov looked at him with a grave and sad air.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3708">Come, do not despise life! continued the examining magistrate.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3709">— It is still long before you. How, you do not want a reduction in sentence! You are very difficult!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3710">— What will I have to look forward to now?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3711">"Life! Are you a prophet to know what it has in store for you? Seek, and you will find. Perhaps God was waiting for you there. Besides, you will not be condemned for life...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3712">“I'll get extenuating circumstances,” Raskolnikov said with a laugh.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3713">— It is, perhaps without your knowing it, a bourgeois shame that prevents you from admitting your guilt; you must rise above that.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3714">"Oh, I don't care!" the young man muttered contemptuously. He made another attempt to rise, but sat down again, visibly dejected.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3715">"You are suspicious and think that I am trying to deceive you, but have you lived much? What do you know about life? You have invented a theory, and it has led in practice to consequences of which the unoriginality now makes you ashamed! You have committed a crime, it is true, but you are not, by any means, a criminal beyond redemption. What is my opinion of you? I consider you as one of those men who would let their entrails be torn out while smiling at their executioners, provided only they had found a faith or a God. Well, find them, and you will live. First, you have long needed a change of air. Then, suffering is a good thing. Suffer. Mikolka is perhaps right in wanting to suffer. I know that you are a skeptic, but, without reasoning, abandon yourself to the current of life: it will carry you somewhere. Where? Do not worry about it, you will always land on a shore. Which one? I do not know, I only believe that you have a long life ahead of you. No doubt at present you are thinking that I am playing my role as an examining magistrate; but perhaps later you will remember my words and you will profit from them; that is why I am speaking to you in this way. It is still very fortunate that you have killed only a wicked old woman. With another theory, you would have committed an action a hundred million times worse. You can still thank God: who knows? perhaps he has plans for you. So have courage and do not retreat, out of pusillanimity, before what justice requires. I know that you do not believe me, but in time you will regain your taste for life. Today you only need air, air, air!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3716">Raskolnikov felt a chill.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3717">“But who are you,” he cried, “to make me these prophecies? What high wisdom permits you to guess my future?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3718">"Who am I? I am a finished man, nothing more. A sensitive and compassionate man to whom experience has perhaps taught something, but a completely finished man. You are another matter: you are at the beginning of existence, and this adventure, who knows? may leave no trace in your life. Why so much dread the change that is going to take place in your situation? Is it the well-being that a heart like yours can regret? Are you distressed to see yourself for a long time confined in darkness? But it depends on you that this darkness is not eternal. Become a sun, and everyone will see you. Why are you still smiling? You think these are the words of an examining magistrate? It is very possible, he! he! he! I do not ask you to believe me on my word, Rodion Romanovitch, - I do my job, I admit; only here is what I add: the event will show you if I am a rogue or an honest man!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3719">— When do you plan to arrest me?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3720">"I can still give you a day and a half or two days of freedom. Think about it, my friend; pray to God to inspire you. The advice I give you is the best to follow, believe me.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3721">"And if I took to the open road?" asked Raskolnikov with a strange smile.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3722">“You will not take it. A moujik will run away; a revolutionary of the day, a valet of other people's thoughts, will run away, because he has a<i class="calibre4">credo</i>blindly accepted for life. But you no longer believe in your theory; what would you take with you if you left? And, besides, what a base and painful existence that of a fugitive! If you run away, you will come back of your own accord.<i class="calibre4">You cannot do without us.</i>When I have you arrested, in a month or two, or three, if you like, you will remember my words and confess. You will be led to it gradually, almost without your own knowledge. I am even persuaded that after due reflection, you will decide to accept the expiation. You don't believe it now, but you will later. For, indeed, Rodion Romanovitch, suffering is a great thing. In the mouth of a coarse man, who has no faith in anything, it sounds ridiculous. But in the mouth of a man who has suffered, it is not ridiculous. Mikolka is right. No, you will not run away, Rodion Romanovitch.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3723">Raskolnikov got up and put on his cap.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3724">Porfiry Petrovitch did the same.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3725">"Are you going for a walk? The evening will be fine, provided there is no storm. Besides, that would be all the better, it would cool the temperature."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3726">“Porfiry Petrovitch,” said the young man in a dry and hurried tone, “I beg you not to imagine that I have made any confessions to you today. You are a strange man, and I listened to you out of pure curiosity. But I have confessed nothing… don't forget that.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3727">“Enough, I won't forget it,” he said. “How he's trembling! Don't worry, my dear, I'll take good note of your recommendation. Take a walk, but don't go beyond certain limits. Just in case, I have another small request to make of you,” he added, lowering his voice, “it's a bit delicate, but it's important: in the unlikely event that during these forty-eight hours you should get the idea to end your life (forgive me for this absurd supposition), well, leave a little note, just two lines, and indicate where the stone is: that would be more noble. Come, goodbye… May God send you good thoughts!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p3728">Porphyry withdrew, avoiding looking at Raskolnikov. He went to the window and waited impatiently for the moment when, according to his calculations, the examining magistrate would be far enough away from the house. Then he himself hurried out.</p>
