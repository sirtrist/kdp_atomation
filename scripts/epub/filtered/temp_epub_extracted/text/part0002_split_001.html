<h2 class="calibre7" id="h21">I</h2>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p17">At the beginning of July, on an extremely hot evening, a young man came out of the small furnished room he occupied under the roof of a large five-story house in the S… Pereulok, and, slowly, with an irresolute air, he headed for the K… bridge.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p18">In the staircase he had the good luck not to meet his landlady. She lived on the floor below, and her kitchen, the door of which was almost constantly open, gave on the staircase. When he had to go out, the young man was therefore obliged to pass under the enemy's fire, and each time he experienced a sickly sensation of fear which humiliated him and made him frown. He owed his landlady quite a lot of money and was afraid of meeting her.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p19">It was not that misfortune had intimidated or broken him; far from it; but for some time he had been in a state of nervous irritation bordering on hypochondria. Isolating himself, shutting himself up in himself, he had come to avoid not only meeting his landlady, but all contact with his fellow men. Poverty crushed him; but in the end he had ceased to be sensitive to it. He had completely given up his daily occupations. At bottom, he did not care about his landlady and the measures she could take against him. But to be stopped in the stairwell, to hear all sorts of nonsense that he did not care about, to endure complaints, threats, complaints, to respond with defeat, excuses, lies, — no, it was better to slip away without being seen by anyone, to slip like a cat along the stairwell.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p20">This time, however, the fear of meeting his creditor surprised him even when he was in the street.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p21">"When I am planning such a bold stroke, why should such trifles frighten me!" he thought with a strange smile. "Hm... yes... man has everything in his hands, and he lets everything slip through his fingers, solely out of cowardice... it's an axiom... I'd be curious to know what people are most afraid of; I think they are most afraid of what takes them out of their habits... But I chatter too much. It's because I chatter that I do nothing. It's true that I could say the same thing: It's because I do nothing that I chatter. For a whole month now I've gotten into the habit of chattering, lying for whole days in a corner, my mind occupied with nonsense. Come on, why am I making this run now? Am I capable of<i class="calibre4">That?</i>Is it that<i class="calibre4">this</i>Is it serious? It is not serious at all. They are nonsense that amuse my imagination, pure chimeras! »</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p22">The street was stiflingly hot. The crowd, the sight of lime, bricks, scaffolding, and that special stench so familiar to the Petersburger who cannot afford to rent a country house for the summer, all contributed to further irritate the young man's already excited nerves. The unbearable smell of the taverns, which were very numerous in this part of the city, and the drunkards who were encountered at every step, although it was a working day, completed the repulsive coloring of the picture. The fine features of our hero betrayed, for an instant, an impression of bitter disgust. Let us say, in passing, that he was not lacking in physical advantages: of above average height, thin and well-built, he had chestnut hair and beautiful dark eyes. But soon after, he fell into a deep reverie or rather into a sort of intellectual torpor. He walked without noticing what was around him and even without wanting to notice it. Only from time to time did he murmur a few words to himself; for, as he himself had recognized just now, he had the habit of monologues. At this moment, he realized that his thoughts were sometimes confused and that he was very weak: for two days, he had, so to speak, eaten nothing.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p23">He was so miserably dressed that anyone else would have hesitated to go out in broad daylight in such rags. To be sure, the neighborhood permitted any kind of costume. In the vicinity of the Haymarket, in those streets of the center of Petersburg where the working population lives, the most heterogeneous dress is nothing to cause surprise. But so much fierce contempt had accumulated in the young man's soul that, despite a sometimes very naïve prudishness, he felt no shame in parading his rags in the street.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p24">It would have been different if he had met someone he knew, one of his old comrades, whom he usually avoided. But he stopped short when he heard himself pointed out to the passers-by by these words, spoken in a mocking voice: "Hey, the German hatmaker!" The man who had uttered this exclamation was a drunkard being taken away in a large cart, we do not know where or why.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p25">With a convulsive gesture, the man who had been addressed took off his hat and began to examine it. It was a tall hat bought at Zimmermann's, but already worn out by use, all rusty, all holey, covered with bumps and stains, deprived of its brim, in a word, hideous. However, far from feeling his self-esteem wounded, the owner of this headgear experienced an impression that was more of anxiety than humiliation.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p26">"I knew it!" he muttered in his agitation. "I felt it! That's the worst of it! A trifle like that, a trifle of no importance, may spoil the whole business! Yes, this hat attracts too much attention. It attracts attention precisely because it is ridiculous. I must have a cap, something to match my rags; any old cap will be better than this horror. Nobody wears such hats; it will be noticed a mile off, and remembered. Later on, people will think about it, and it will be a clue. Now it is a matter of attracting as little attention as possible. Little things are important, it is always by little things that one gets caught."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p27">He had not far to go; he even knew the exact distance between his house and the place he was going: just seven hundred and thirty paces. He had counted them when his plan was still in the form of a vague dream in his mind. At that time, he himself did not believe that he should pass from idea to action; he simply contented himself with caressing in imagination a chimera at once terrifying and seductive. But since that time a month had elapsed, and already he was beginning to consider things differently. Although, in all his soliloquies, he reproached himself for his lack of energy and indecision, nevertheless he had gradually, almost in spite of himself, become accustomed to regard the realization of his dream as possible, while continuing to doubt himself. At this moment, he was coming to make the final decision.<i class="calibre4">repetition</i>of his enterprise, and, at every step, his agitation was increasing.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p28">With a sinking heart and a nervous tremor in his limbs, he approached a huge house that looked out on the canal on one side and the street on the other. This building, divided into a multitude of small apartments, was rented by artisans of all sorts: tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of various categories, prostitutes, petty officials, etc. A swarm of people were coming and going through both doors. Three or four dvorniks were attached to the service of this house. To his great satisfaction, the young man did not meet any of them; after crossing the threshold without being seen, he immediately took the right staircase.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p29">He already knew this dark and narrow staircase, whose darkness was far from displeasing to him: it was so dark that one did not have to fear curious glances. "If I'm already so scared now, what will it be like when I come here<i class="calibre4">Really?</i>"What a long staircase!" he could not help thinking as he reached the fourth floor. There his way was blocked by a group of former soldiers who had become porters, moving out the furniture from a flat occupied, as the young man knew, by a German official and his family. "Thanks to the departure of this German, there will be no other tenant on this landing for some time except the old woman. That's good to know... just in case..." he thought, and rang the old woman's bell. The bell rang feebly, as if it were made of tin, not copper. In such houses the bells of the small flats are usually like that.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p30">He had forgotten this detail; the particular ringing of the bell must have suddenly reminded him of something, for he shivered; his nerves were very weak. After a while, the door opened a crack, and through the narrow opening the landlady examined the newcomer with evident distrust; her little eyes appeared alone like luminous points in the darkness. But, seeing people in the square, she reassured herself and opened the door wide. The young man entered a dark antechamber divided in two by a partition behind which was a small kitchen. Standing before him, the old woman was silent and questioning him with her eyes. She was a woman of sixty, small and thin, with a small pointed nose and eyes sparkling with malice.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p31">She was bareheaded, and her hair, which was beginning to turn gray, was shining with oil. A flannel rag was wrapped around her neck, which was long and thin like a chicken's leg; despite the heat, she was wearing a yellowed, shaggy fur on her shoulders. The old woman coughed every moment. It is likely that the young man looked at her in a strange way, for his eyes suddenly resumed their expression of distrust.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p32">“Raskolnikov, a student. I came to see you a month ago,” the visitor hastened to say, bowing half-way down; he had reflected that it was better to be more polite.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p33">“I remember, batuchka, I remember very well,” replied the old woman, who never ceased to regard him with a suspicious eye.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p34">"Well, here it is," continued Raskolnikov, somewhat disturbed and surprised at the mistrust he was shown. "I have come again on a small matter of the same kind."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p35">"After all, perhaps she is always like that, but I did not notice it the other time," he thought, unpleasantly impressed.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p36">The old woman remained silent for a while, as if she were thinking. Then she pointed to the door of the room to her visitor and said, stepping aside to let him pass in front of her:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p37">— Come in, batuchka.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p38">The little room into which the young man was introduced was hung with yellow paper; there were geraniums and muslin curtains at the windows; the setting sun cast a harsh light over everything. "<i class="calibre4">So</i>"No doubt the sun will shine in the same way!" Raskolnikov suddenly thought, and he quickly glanced around the room to get a sense of the surrounding objects and to etch them in his memory. But the room contained nothing special. The yellow wood furniture was all very old. A sofa with a large, overturned back, an oval table opposite the sofa, a toilet and a mirror leaning against the trumeau, chairs along the walls, two or three worthless engravings depicting German girls with birds in their hands — that was all the furniture consisted of.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p39">In a corner, before a little image, a lamp was burning. The furniture and the floor were shining with cleanliness. "It is Elizabeth who does the housework," thought the young man. One could not have discovered a grain of dust in the whole apartment. "One must go to the houses of these wicked old widows to see such cleanliness," Raskolnikoff continued to himself, and he looked with curiosity at the chintz curtain which hid the door leading to a second little room: in this last, where he had never set foot, were the bed and the chest of drawers of the old woman. The whole apartment consisted of these two rooms.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p40">“What do you want?” asked the landlady dryly, who, after following her visitor, came and stood opposite him to examine him face to face.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p41">"I came to hire something, that's all!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p42">Upon which he drew from his pocket an old, flat silver watch. A globe was engraved on the case. The chain was steel.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p43">“But you haven't repaid the sum I lent you already! The deadline was yesterday…”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p44">"I will pay you the interest for another month; be patient a little."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p45">— I am free, batuchka, to wait or to sell your object right now, if it pleases me.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p46">“What will you give me for this watch, Alena Ivanovna?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p47">"But this is a wretched thing you bring me, my dear, it is worth, so to speak, nothing. The last time I lent you two notes on your ring, and for a rouble and a half you can buy a new one at a jeweler's."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p48">— Give me four roubles, and I will redeem it; it came to me from my father. I shall soon receive money.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p49">— A ruble and a half, and I take the interest in advance.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p50">"A rouble and a half!" cried the young man.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p51">— It's take it or leave it.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p52">Upon this, the old woman handed him the watch. The visitor took it back, and, in his irritation, was about to withdraw, when he reflected that the pawnbroker was his last resource: besides, he had come for something else.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p53">“Come on, give it to me!” he said in a brutal tone.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p54">The old woman searched her pocket for her keys and went into the other room. Left alone in the middle of the room, the young man listened attentively, while making various inferences. He heard the usurer open the chest of drawers. "That must be the top drawer," he thought. "I know now that she carries her keys in her right pocket... They are all joined together by an iron ring... There is one that is three times bigger than the others and has a serrated bit; that one, no doubt, does not open the chest of drawers... Consequently, there is still some chest or some safe... That is curious. Safe keys generally have this shape... But, besides, how ignoble all this is..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p55">The old woman appeared again.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p56">— Here, little father: if I take a grivna <span class="superscript-rw"></span> <span class="superscript-rw"> <span class="ref-note-rw" id="rw-ref-note-1"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre3 pcalibre4 pcalibre pcalibre1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0010.html#rw-num-note-1">1</a></span> </span> <span class="superscript-rw"><p class="Standard">The calculation of probabilities is a vain science, and we must be wary of that obscure instinct we called common sense, which we asked to legitimize our conventions.</p></span> per month and per ruble, on a ruble and a half I have to deduct fifteen kopecks, the interest being payable in advance. In addition, since you ask me to wait another month for the repayment of the two rubles that I have already lent you, you owe me, on that account, twenty kopecks, which brings the total amount to thirty-five. I therefore have to give you, on your watch, a ruble fifteen kopecks. Here, take it.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p57">— What! You only give me one rouble fifteen kopecks now?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p58">— You have nothing more to receive.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p59">Without arguing, the young man took the money. He looked at the old woman and did not hurry to leave. He seemed to want to say or do something else, but he himself did not seem to know exactly what ...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p60">"Perhaps, Alena Ivanovna, I'll bring you another thing soon... a cigarette case... silver... very nice... when a friend to whom I lent it will return it to me..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p61">He uttered these words with a very embarrassed air.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p62">— Well, then, we will talk about it again, batuchka.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p63">"Good-bye. And are you still alone at home? Does your sister not keep you company?" he asked in the most indifferent tone he could assume, as he entered the antechamber.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p64">“But what do you care about my sister, batuchka?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p65">"That is true. I asked the question without attaching any importance to it. I will come to you at once. Good-bye, Alena Ivanovna!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p66">Raskolnikov left, very troubled. As he descended the stairs, he stopped several times, as if overcome by the violence of his emotions. Finally, arriving in the street, he cried out: "Oh my God! how all this raises the heart! Can it be, can it be that I ... No, it's a stupidity, an absurdity! he added resolutely. And such a terrible idea could come to my mind? What infamy must I be capable of? It is odious, ignoble, repulsive! ... And for a whole month, I ... "</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p67">But words and exclamations were powerless to express the agitation he was experiencing. The feeling of immense disgust that had begun to oppress him while he was on his way to the old woman, now reached such an intensity that he did not know what to do to escape this torment. He walked along the sidewalk like a drunken man, not noticing the passersby and bumping into them. In the next street, he came to his senses. Looking around him, he realized that he was near a tavern; a staircase located below the sidewalk gave access to the basement of this establishment. Raskolnikov saw two drunks come out at the same time, supporting each other, while calling each other names.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p68">The young man hesitated for scarcely a minute, then he went down the stairs. He had never before entered a tavern, but at that moment his head was swimming, and he was also tormented by a burning thirst. He wanted to drink some cold beer, all the more so because he attributed his weakness to the emptiness of his stomach. After sitting down in a dark and dirty corner, in front of a small, sticky table, he ordered beer and drank a first glass greedily.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p69">A great relief immediately manifested itself in him, his ideas cleared up: "All this is absurd," he said to himself, reassured, "and there was nothing to be troubled about! It is simply a physical malaise! A glass of beer, a piece of biscuit, and in an instant I will have regained the strength of my intelligence, the clarity of my thought, the vigor of my resolutions! Oh! how insignificant all this is!" Notwithstanding this disdainful conclusion, he looked gay, as if he had suddenly been relieved of a terrible weight, and he cast a friendly glance at the people present. But, at the same time, he vaguely suspected that this return of energy was itself factitious.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p70">There were now only a few people left in the tavern. After the two drunk men we have mentioned, a band of five musicians had left. After their departure, the establishment became silent, for there were only three people left. A man slightly intoxicated, and whose appearance indicated a small bourgeois, was sitting in front of a bottle of beer. Next to him, a tall and fat man, dressed in a long frock coat and wearing a white beard, was sleeping on a bench, in a state of complete drunkenness.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p71">From time to time, the latter seemed to wake up suddenly; he would then start snapping his fingers, spreading his arms and making rapid movements with his torso, without getting up from the bench on which he was lying. This gesticulation accompanied some inept song, whose verses he was trying to find in his memory:</p>

<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p77">But no one shared the musician's happiness. His companion himself listened to all these roulades in silence and with an unhappy expression. The third consumer appeared to be an old civil servant. Seated in a corner, he raised his glass to his lips from time to time and looked around. He, too, seemed to be in a state of some agitation.</p>
