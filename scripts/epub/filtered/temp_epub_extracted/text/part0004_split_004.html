<h2 class="calibre7" id="h218">IV</h2>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1893">At that moment, the door opened silently; a young girl entered the room, casting timid glances around her. Her appearance caused general surprise, and all eyes fixed on her with curiosity. Raskolnikov did not recognize her at first. It was Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov. He had seen her the day before for the first time, but in circumstances and in a costume that had left a completely different image of her in his memory. Now she was a young girl in modest and even poor attire, with proper and reserved manners, and a fearful countenance. She wore a very simple little dress and an old, outdated hat. Nothing remained of her attire of the day before, except that she still had her umbrella in her hand. On seeing all these people, whom she had not expected to find there, she was extremely confused, and she even took a step back.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1894">"Ah!... it is you?" said Raskolnikov, in the utmost astonishment, and suddenly he himself felt confused.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1895">He remembered that in the letter read by his mother and sister, Luzhin had referred to a certain young lady of "notorious misconduct." He had just protested against Luzhin's calumny, and declared that he had seen the young lady for the first time the day before; and yet here she was herself, coming to him! He remembered also that he had allowed the words "of notorious misconduct" to pass without protest. All these thoughts flashed through his mind in a moment. But, looking more attentively at the poor creature, he saw that she was so overwhelmed by shame that he felt sorry for her. At the moment when, frightened, she was about to leave the room, a sort of revolution took place in him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1896">“I was not expecting you at all,” he said hastily, inviting her to stay with a look. “Do me the favor of sitting down. You must be coming from Catherine Ivanovna. Excuse me, not there; sit down here…”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1897">At Sonia's arrival, Razumihin, sitting near the door on one of the three chairs in the room, had half risen to let the young girl pass. Raskolnikov's first movement had been to indicate to her the corner of the sofa where Zosimov had been sitting a moment before; but thinking of the intimate character of this piece of furniture, which served as his own bed, he changed his mind and showed Sonia Razumihin's chair.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1898">"You, sit here," he said to his friend, making him take the place previously occupied by the doctor.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1899">Sonia sat down almost trembling with fear, and timidly glanced at the two ladies. It was evident that she could not understand how she had dared to sit down beside them. This thought caused her such agitation that she rose suddenly, and, all confused, addressed Raskolnikov:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1900">"I... I came for a minute. Forgive me for disturbing you," she said in a hesitant voice. "It was Katerina Ivanovna who sent me, she had no one else to send... Katerina Ivanovna begs you most earnestly to be present tomorrow morning... at the funeral service... at Saint Mitrophane's, and afterwards to come to us... to her house... to have a bite to eat... She hopes you will do her this honour."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1901">After these few painfully articulated words, Sonia fell silent.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1902">I will certainly try... I will do my best, stammered Raskolnikov in turn, who had also half risen.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1903">"Have the kindness to sit down," he added abruptly, "I beg of you. Perhaps you are in a hurry? I should like to have a little talk with you; do me the favor of giving me two minutes."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1904">At the same time he motioned her to sit down again. Sonia obeyed; she cast another timid glance at the two ladies and suddenly dropped her eyes. Raskolnikov's features contracted, his pale face became crimson, his eyes flashed.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1905">“Mother,” he said in a trembling voice, “it is Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov, the daughter of that unfortunate Mr. Marmeladov who was run over yesterday before my eyes, and of whom I have already spoken to you.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1906">Pulcheria Alexandrovna glanced at Sonia and slightly winked. Despite the fear she felt for her son, she could not deny herself this satisfaction. Dounia turned to the poor girl and began to examine her seriously. On hearing her name pronounced by Raskolnikov, Sonia raised her eyes again, but her embarrassment only increased.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1907">"I wanted to ask you," the young man hurried to say, "how things went at your place today... Were you not harassed? Did you have any trouble with the police?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1908">“No, there was nothing… the cause of death was too obvious, anyway, they left us alone; only the tenants are angry.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1909">— Why?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1910">"They say that the body has been in the house too long... It's hot now, and the smell... so today, at vespers, they'll take it to the chapel in the cemetery, where it will stay until tomorrow. At first, Katerina Ivanovna didn't want to, but she finally realized that there was no other way..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1911">— So the funeral is today?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1912">— Catherine Ivanovna hopes that you will do us the honor of attending the funeral tomorrow, and that you will come to her house afterwards to take part in the funeral meal.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1913">— She is giving a dinner?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1914">— Yes, a collation; she asked me to convey to you all her thanks for the help you gave us yesterday… Without you, we would not have been able to afford the funeral.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1915">A sudden tremor shook the lips and chin of the young girl, but she mastered her emotion and again fixed her eyes on the ground.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1916">During this dialogue, Raskolnikov had looked at her attentively. Sonia had a thin, pale face; her small nose and chin were angular and pointed; the whole was rather irregular, and she could not be called pretty. On the other hand, her blue eyes were so limpid, and when they lighted up, gave her face such an expression of goodness, that one involuntarily felt drawn to her. Besides, another characteristic feature was noticeable in her face as well as in her whole person: she seemed much younger than her age, and, although she was eighteen, she might almost have been taken for a girl. This sometimes even lent a touch of the ridiculous to some of her movements.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1917">“But is it possible that Katerina Ivanovna can get along on such a small income? And she still thinks of giving a party?” asked Raskolnikov.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1918">"The coffin will be very simple," he said, "everything will be done modestly, so that it won't cost much. Catherine Ivanovna and I have calculated it all; after all the expenses are paid, there will still be enough left for a meal, and Catherine Ivanovna is very anxious to have one. There's nothing to be said against it. It will be a consolation to her. You know what she is."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1919">"I understand, I understand... perhaps... You are looking at my room? Mother says the same thing, that it looks like a tomb."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1920">“Yesterday you gave up everything for us!” Sonia replied in a low, rapid voice, lowering her eyes again. Her lips and chin began to twitch again. She had been struck by the poverty of Raskolnikov's lodgings from the moment she arrived, and these words escaped her spontaneously. There was a silence. Dounia's eyes brightened, and Pulcheria Alexandrovna herself looked at Sonia with a friendly expression.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1921">"Rodia," she said, rising, "we'll have dinner together, of course. Dounia, let's go. But you, Rodia, ought to go out for a little walk first, and then come back and rest a little, and then go to us as soon as possible... I'm afraid we've tired you out."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1922">Yes, yes, I will come, he hastened to reply, rising also.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1923">— Besides, I have something to do…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1924">"Come, you're not going to dine separately," cried Razumihin, looking at Raskolnikov with amazement; "you can't do that!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1925">“No, no, I'll come, certainly, certainly… But you, stay a minute. You don't need him right away, Maman? I'm not depriving you of him?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1926">"Oh, no, no! You too, Dmitri Prokofitch, please be kind enough to come to dinner with us!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1927">"I beg you to come," added Dounia.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1928">Razumikhin bowed, beaming. For a moment, everyone felt a strange embarrassment.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1929">“Good-bye, Rodya,” she said, “that is to say, au revoir. I don't like to say good-bye.” “Good-bye, Nastasya… Oh, I say, I've said it again!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1930">Pulcheria Alexandrovna had intended to greet Sonia, but, in spite of all her good will, she could not bring herself to do so, and she hurried out of the room.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1931">Avdotia Romanovna, on the contrary, seemed to have been waiting impatiently for this moment. When, after her mother, she passed Sonia, she made her a formal bow. The poor girl was confused, bowed with a frightened haste, and her face even betrayed a painful impression, as if Avdotia Romanovna's politeness had painfully affected her.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1932">“Dounia, goodbye!” cried Raskolnikov in the vestibule. “Give me your hand!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1933">“But I've already given it to you; have you forgotten?” answered Dounia, turning to him with a friendly air, though she felt a little embarrassed.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1934">— Well, give it to me again!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1935">And he squeezed his sister's little fingers tightly. Dounia smiled at him, blushing, then quickly pulled her hand away and followed her mother. She was also very happy, for reasons we could not fathom.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1936">"Well, that's very good!" said the young man, returning to Sonia, who had remained in the room. At the same time he looked at her with a serene air. "Let the Lord give peace to the dead, but let the living live! Isn't that so?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1937">Sonia noticed with surprise that Raskolnikov's face had suddenly brightened; for a few moments he looked at her in silence: everything Marmeladov had told him about his daughter suddenly came back to him…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1938">"Here is the business I have to talk to you about," said Raskolnikov, drawing Razumihin into the window-recess.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1939">— So I shall tell Catherine Ivanovna that you will come?…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1940">As she said this, Sonia was preparing to take her leave.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1941">— I'll be with you in a moment, Sophie Semyonovna, we have no secrets, you are not in the way… I would like to say a few more words to you…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1942">And, suddenly interrupting himself, he turned to Razumihin:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1943">“Do you know that… What's his name, anyway?… Porfiry Petrovitch?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1944">"If I know him! He's my cousin! Well?" replied Razumihin, greatly intrigued by this introduction.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1945">— Yesterday, didn't you say that he was investigating… this case… the case about the murder?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1946">"Yes... well?" asked Razumikhin, opening his eyes wide.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1947">"He was inquiring, you say, about the people who had pawned things at the old woman's; well, I myself pawned something there; it's hardly worth mentioning: a little ring that my sister gave me when I left for Petersburg, and a silver watch that belonged to my father. The whole thing is worth five or six roubles, but I value it as a keepsake. What should I do now? I don't want these things to be lost, especially the watch. I was afraid just now that my mother might ask to see it, when they were talking about Dounia's. It's the only thing we have left of my father. If it's lost, my mother will be ill! Women! So tell me what I should do! I know I should report it to the police. But wouldn't it be better if I went to Porfiry himself? What do you think? I'm eager to settle this matter. You'll see that before dinner, my mother will have already asked me about the watch."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1948">"It is not to the police we must go, but to Porfiry!" cried Razumihin, in extraordinary agitation.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1949">“Oh! how glad I am! But we can go there at once, it is only a step away; we are sure to find him!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1950">— Very well, let us go.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1951">"He will be positively delighted to make your acquaintance! I have spoken of you to him several times… yesterday, too. Let us go!… So you knew the old woman? It all comes together admirably! Ah! yes… Sophie Ivanovna…"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1952">Sofya Semyonovna, corrected Raskolnikov.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1953">— Sophie Semyonovna, this is my friend, Razumihin, a good man.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1954">"If you have to go out," began Sonia, who was even more embarrassed by this introduction and did not dare to raise her eyes to Razumihin.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1955">"Well, let's go," decided Raskolnikov. "I'll come to your place in the course of the day, Sofya Semyonovna; only tell me where you live."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1956">He said these words, not precisely with an embarrassed air, but with a certain haste and avoiding the young girl's gaze. She gave her address, not without blushing. All three went out together.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1957">"Are you not going to lock your door?" asked Razumihin, as they went down the stairs.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1958">Never! Besides, I've been meaning to buy a lock for two years now," said Raskolnikov carelessly.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1959">"Happy, aren't they, the people who have nothing to lock up?" he added gaily, addressing Sonia.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1960">On the threshold of the great door, they stopped.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1961">"You are going to the right, Sophie Semyonovna? By the way, how did you find out where I live?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1962">It was evident that what he said was not what he wanted to say; he kept looking at the young girl's clear and gentle eyes.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1963">"But you gave Poletchka your address yesterday."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1964">“What Poletchka? Ah! yes… it's the little one… it's your sister? So I gave her my address?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1965">— Did you forget it?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1966">— No… I remember…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1967">“I had already heard of you from the deceased… Only I did not know your name then, and he did not know it himself… Now I have come… and when I learned your name yesterday… I asked today: This is where he lives</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1968">Mr. Raskolnikov? I didn't know you lived in a boarding house too. Goodbye. I'll tell Katerina Ivanovna.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1969">Very glad to be able to leave at last, Sonia walked away with a quick step and her eyes cast down. She was impatient to reach the first corner to the right, to escape the sight of the two young men and to think without witnesses of all the incidents of this visit. She had never experienced anything like it. A whole unknown world was confusedly arising in her soul. She suddenly remembered that Raskolnikov had spontaneously expressed the intention of going to see her today: perhaps he would come in the morning, perhaps right now!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1970">May he not come today! she murmured, anxious.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1971">— Lord! In my house... in this room... he will see... Oh Lord!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1972">She was too preoccupied to notice that she had been followed by a stranger since leaving the house. At the moment when Raskolnikov, Razumihin, and Sonia had stopped on the pavement to talk for a minute, the stranger had happened to pass by them. Sonia's words, “I asked: does Mr. Raskolnikov live here?” reached his ears by chance and almost made him start. He glanced furtively at the three interlocutors, and particularly at Raskolnikov, to whom the young girl had addressed herself; then he examined the house in order to be able to recognize it if necessary. All this was done in a flash and as unobtrusively as possible; after which the stranger walked away, slowing his pace as if he were waiting for someone. It was Sonia he was waiting for; soon he saw her take leave of the two young men and walk toward her lodging.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1973">"Where does she live? I have seen that face somewhere," he thought; "I must find out."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1974">When he reached the corner of the street, he crossed to the other sidewalk, turned around, and saw that the young girl was walking in the same direction as he was; she noticed nothing. When she reached the corner of the street, she took that side. He began to follow her, walking on the opposite sidewalk, and did not take his eyes off her. After fifty paces, he crossed the street, caught up with the young girl, and walked behind her at a distance of five paces.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1975">He was a man of fifty, but very well preserved and looking much younger than his age. Of above average height, of respectable corpulence, he had broad shoulders and a slightly stooped back. Dressed in a manner as elegant as it was comfortable, wearing fresh gloves, he held a fine cane in his hand, which he made to resound at every step on the sidewalk. Everything about him betrayed a gentleman. His broad face was quite pleasant; at the same time the brightness of his complexion and his ruddy lips did not allow him to be taken for a Petersburger. His hair, still very thick, had remained very blond and was just beginning to turn gray; his beard, long, wide, and well-trimmed, was even lighter in color than his hair. His blue eyes had a cold, serious, and fixed gaze.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1976">The stranger had had enough time to observe Sonia to notice that the young girl was distracted and dreamy. When she arrived at her house, she crossed the threshold; the barin who was behind her continued to follow her, while appearing a little surprised. After entering the courtyard, Sonia took the stairs to the right, the one that led to her apartment. "Bah!" said the gentleman to himself, and he climbed the stairs after her. Only then did Sonia notice the presence of the stranger. Arriving on the third floor, she entered a corridor and rang the bell at number 9, where the following two words were written in chalk on the door:<i class="calibre4">Kapernaoumoff, tailor</i>"Bah!" repeated the stranger, surprised at this coincidence, and he rang at the next door, number 8. The two doors were six paces apart.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1977">"You live at Kapernaumov's?" he asked Sonia, laughing.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1978">“He mended a waistcoat for me yesterday. I live here, near you, in the apartment of Madame Resslich, Gertrude Karlovna. How strange!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1979">Sonia looked at him attentively.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1980">We are neighbors, he continued in a cheerful tone.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1981">"I have only been in Petersburg since the day before yesterday. Well, until we meet again!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1982">Sonia did not answer. The door opened, and the girl went in quickly. She felt embarrassed, ashamed…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1983">Razumihin was very animated as he walked to Porfiry's with his friend.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1984">"That's perfect, my dear," he repeated several times, "and I'm delighted, delighted! I didn't know you had also pawned something with the old woman. And... and... how long ago was that? I mean, how long ago did you go to her?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1985">When was it?… asked Raskolnikov, as if trying to recall his memories:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1986">"It was, I believe, the day before her death that I went to her. Besides, it is not a question of my recovering these things now," he added hastily, as if this question had been of great importance to him; "I find I have only a rouble left... thanks to the follies I committed yesterday under the influence of this accursed delirium!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1987">He laid particular stress on the word "delirium."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1988">"Come, yes, yes, yes," Razumihin hurriedly said, answering a thought that had come to him, "so that's why then you... the thing struck me... you see? while you were wandering about the countryside, you talked of nothing but rings and watch-chains!... Come, yes, yes... It's clear, now everything's clear."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1989">"There! that idea has crept into their minds! I now have proof of it: this man would be crucified for me, and he is very happy to be able to explain why I spoke of rings during my delirium! My language must have confirmed them all in their suspicions!..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1990">"But shall we find it?" he asked aloud.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1991">"We will find him," Razumihin answered without hesitation. "He is a wonderful fellow, my dear boy, you will see! A little awkward, it is true; I don't mean to say that he is lacking in manners; no, it is in another way that I think him awkward. He is far from being a fool, he is even very intelligent; only he has a peculiar turn of mind... He is incredulous, sceptical, cynical... he likes to mystify people... With that, he is faithful to the old school, that is to say, he admits only material proofs... But he is a good fellow, and he knows his business. Last year he unravelled a murder case in which almost all the clues were missing! He is eager to make your acquaintance!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1992">— Why does he insist on it so much?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1993">"Oh, it's not that... you see, in these last days, while you were sick, we often had the opportunity to talk about you... He was present at our conversations... When he learned that you were a law student and that you had been forced to leave the University, he said: "What a pity!" I concluded... that is, I did not base myself on that alone, but on many other things. Yesterday, Zametov... Listen, Rodia: when I brought you back home yesterday, I was drunk, and I was babbling all sorts of nonsense; I'm afraid you took my words too seriously...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1994">"What did you tell me? That they consider me a madman? Well, perhaps they are right," Raskolnikov answered with a forced smile.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1995">They were silent. Razumihin was in a state of ecstasy, and Raskolnikov noticed it with vexation. What his friend had just told him about the examining magistrate did not fail to disturb him also.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1996">"In that grey house," said Razumihin.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1997">"The main thing is to find out," thought Raskolnikov, "whether Porfiry knows about my visit yesterday to the lodgings of that witch and about the question I asked about the blood. I must be certain about that first of all; I must read it in his face from the first moment, from the moment I enter the room; otherwise... even if I lose everything, I must know for sure."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1998">Do you know something? he said suddenly, turning to Razumihin with a sly smile:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1999">"It seems to me, my friend, that you have been in an extraordinary state of agitation since this morning. Is that true?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2000">"What? Not at all!" Razumihin replied, offended.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2001">“I am not mistaken, my friend. At times you were sitting on the edge of your chair, which never happens to you, and you looked as if you had cramps. You jumped at every moment. Your mood was constantly changing; you got angry and then, a moment later, you were all honey and sugar. You even blushed; it was especially when you were invited to dinner that you turned red.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2002">“But no, that's absurd, why do you say that?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2003">"Really, you have the timidity of a schoolboy! The devil, he's blushing again!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2004">“You are insufferable.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2005">— But why this confusion, Romeo? Let it go, today, I will tell it somewhere, ha, ha, ha! I will amuse my mother very much... and another person too...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2006">"Listen, listen, listen, this is serious; you see, it's... After that, the devil..." Razumikhin muttered, chilled with fear. "What will you tell them? My friend, I... Oh! what a pig you are!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2007">"A real spring rose! And if you only knew how it becomes you! A Romeo of two arshins and twelve vershoks! But I hope you washed yourself today! You even cleaned your nails, didn't you? When was that? God forgive me, I think you've put on pomade! Bend your head down, so I can smell it!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2008">— Pig! ! !</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2009">Raskolnikov burst into a fit of laughter, and this hilarity, which he seemed powerless to control, was still going on when the two young men arrived at Porfiry Petrovich's. From the apartment one could hear the visitor's laughter in the anteroom, and Raskolnikov counted on it being heard.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2010">"If you say a word, I'll knock you down!" Razumihin muttered furiously, seizing his friend by the shoulder.</p>
