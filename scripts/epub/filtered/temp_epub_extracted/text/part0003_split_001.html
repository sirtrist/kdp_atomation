<h2 class="calibre7" id="h28">I</h2>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p587">Raskolnikov lay in this position for a long time. At times he seemed to be emerging from this half-sleep, and then he noticed that the night was already far advanced; but the idea of getting up did not enter his head. At last he noticed that day was beginning to dawn. Lying on his back on the sofa, he had not yet shaken off the kind of lethargy that had fallen upon him. Terrible, despairing cries, coming from the street, reached his ears; they were, in fact, those which he heard every night, about two o'clock, under his window. This time the noise woke him up.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p588">"Ah! here are the drunkards already coming out of the taverns," he thought, "it is two o'clock," and he gave a sudden start as if someone had pulled him off the sofa.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p589">— “How! it is already two o'clock!” He sat down on the sofa and suddenly remembered everything!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p590">At first he thought he was going mad. He felt a terrible chill, but it was also due to the fever that had seized him during his sleep. Now he was shivering so much that his teeth were almost chattering. He opened the door and listened: the whole house was asleep. He looked around him in astonishment, at himself and at his room: how, the night before, when he had come home, had he forgotten to close his door with the hook? How had he been able to throw himself on his sofa, not only without undressing, but even without taking off his hat? The latter had rolled on the floor and was lying on the parquet next to the pillow.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p591">— "If someone came in here, what would he think? That I am drunk, but ..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p592">He ran to the window. It was quite light, and the young man examined himself from head to foot to see if there were any stains on his clothes. But there was no reason to trust such an inspection: still shivering, he undressed and inspected his clothes again, looking everywhere with the greatest care. For added precaution, he repeated this examination three times in a row. He found nothing, except a few drops of coagulated blood on the bottom of his trousers, whose edges were frayed from tears. He took a large folding knife and cut the fringes. Suddenly, he remembered that the purse and the objects he had taken from the old woman's chest were still in his pockets! He had not yet thought to take them out and hide them somewhere! He hadn't even thought about it just now, while he was examining his clothes! Was it possible?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p593">In a flash, he emptied his pockets and laid the contents on the table. Then, after turning his pockets inside out to make sure there was nothing left in them, he carried everything to a corner of the room. In this place, the dilapidated tapestry was detached from the wall; it was there, under the paper, that he stuffed the jewels and the purse. "That's it! Neither seen nor known!" he thought with joy, half-rising and looking with a dazed look in the corner where the torn tapestry yawned more than ever. Suddenly, fear shook all his limbs:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p594">"My God!" he murmured with despair, "what is the matter with me? Is it hidden? Is that the way to hide something?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p595">To tell the truth, this booty was not what he had hoped for; he had only intended to take the old woman's money; and so the necessity of hiding these jewels took him by surprise.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p596">"But now, now, have I reason to rejoice?" he thought. "Is this the way to hide something? Truly, my reason is deserting me!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p597">Exhausted, he sat down on the sofa, and immediately a violent shiver shook all his limbs again. Mechanically he pulled a ragged old winter coat towards him, which was lying on a chair, and covered himself with it. A sleep mingled with delirium seized him instantly. He lost consciousness of himself.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p598">Five minutes later he woke up again with a start, and his first movement was to bend anxiously over his clothes. "How could I have gone back to sleep when nothing is done! For I have done nothing, the noose is still in the place where I sewed it! I had not thought of that! Such a piece of evidence!" He tore the collar off and immediately reduced it to small pieces, which he stuffed under the pillow with his linen.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p599">"These rags of cloth cannot in any way arouse suspicion, at least, as far as I can see," he repeated, standing in the middle of the room, and, with an attention that the effort made painful, he looked all around him, trying to make sure that he had not forgotten anything.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p600">He suffered cruelly from the conviction that everything, even memory, even the most elementary prudence, was abandoning him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p601">"What! is the punishment already beginning? There! there! indeed!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p602">Sure enough, the fringes he had cut off the bottom of his trousers were still lying on the floor in the middle of the room, exposed to the view of the first person who came in.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p603">“But where have I put my head?” he cried, as if in despair.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p604">Then a strange idea came to him: he thought that his clothes were perhaps all bloody, and that the weakening of his faculties had alone prevented him from seeing the stains ... Suddenly he remembered that there was also blood on the purse. "Bah! then there must also be blood in my pocket, because the purse was still wet when I put it there!" Immediately he turned his pocket inside out, and indeed he found stains on the lining. "So reason has not yet left me completely; I have not lost my memory and reflection, since I made this remark myself!" he thought triumphantly, while a sigh of satisfaction came from the bottom of his chest; "I just had a minute of fever that took away my intelligence."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p605">He then tore out the entire lining of his left trouser pocket. At that moment, a ray of sunlight fell on his left boot: on the tip he seemed to see revealing clues. He took off his boot: "Indeed, these are clues! The whole tip of my boot is stained with blood." He had probably then imprudently put his foot in that puddle ... "But what to do now with this? How to get rid of this boot, these fringes, this lining? "</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p606">He stood there in the middle of the room, holding in his hand all these incriminating pieces of evidence that were so damning to him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p607">"If I threw them into the stove? But they'll look in the stove first. If I burned them? And with what to burn them? I don't even have matches. No, it's better to go throw all this away somewhere. The best thing is to go throw all this away!" he repeated, sitting down on the sofa again, "and right away, at once, without a minute's delay!" But instead of carrying out this resolution, he let his head fall back on the pillow; the shivering seized him again, and, chilled to the bone, he wrapped himself up again in his coat. For a long time, for several hours, this thought presented itself almost constantly to his mind: "It must be thrown away somewhere as soon as possible!" Several times he stirred on the sofa, wanted to get up, and could not succeed. Finally, loud knocks on his door roused him from his torpor.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p608">It was Nastasia who was knocking.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p609">"Open up, if you're not dead!" cried the servant; "he sleeps all the time! He snoozes like a dog, for whole days at a time! He's a real dog, anyway! Open up, I say. It's past ten o'clock."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p610">"But perhaps he is not at home!" said a man's voice. "Bah! it is the dvornik's voice... What does he want?" He started and sat down on the sofa. His heart beat so violently that it hurt him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p611">And who could have closed the door with the hook? Nastasia replied.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p612">“Monsieur has locked himself in! He probably thinks he's a rare coin, and he's afraid someone will steal him! Open up, wake up!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p613">“What do they want? Why has the dvornik come up? Everything is discovered. Shall I resist or open the door? Plague take them!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p614">He half rose, leaned forward, and unhooked the latch. His room was so small that he could open the door without leaving the sofa.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p615">He saw Nastasia and the dvornik before him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p616">The servant looked at Raskolnikov with a strange expression. The young man looked at the dvornik with desperate audacity, who silently handed him a gray paper, folded in two and sealed with coarse wax.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p617">“It's a summons, it comes from the police station,” he said later.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p618">— From what police station?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p619">— From the police station, of course. We all know which one.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p620">— I am summoned to the police!… Why?…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p621">"How can I know that?" he said. "You are called, go."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p622">He examined the tenant attentively, then looked around him and prepared to retire.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p623">"You look worse than ever," observed Nastasia, who never took her eyes off Raskolnikov. At these words the dvornik turned his head.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p624">"He has had a fever since yesterday," she added.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p625">He did not answer, and still held the letter in his hands without opening it.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p626">"But stay in bed," continued the servant, moved to pity at seeing him get up. "You are ill; well, don't go. There is no hurry. What have you got in your hands?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p627">The young man looked: he was holding in his right hand the fringes of his trousers, his boot, and the lining of the pocket he had torn off. He had slept with it. Later, trying to explain the fact, he remembered that he had half awakened in a feverish transport, and that after tightly gripping all these objects in his hand, he had fallen asleep again without unclenching his fingers.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p628">"He's collected rags, and he's sleeping with them as if they were a treasure." Having said this, Nastasia twisted her body, seized by her usual nervous, sickly laughter. Raskolnikov hastily hid everything he had in his hands under his coat and fixed a penetrating gaze on the servant. Although he was then in a very poor state of mind, he felt that one does not address a man in this way when one comes to arrest him; "but... the police?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p629">“Will you have some tea? Would you like me to bring you some? There's some left…”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p630">“No… I'll go, I'll go right away,” he stammered.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p631">“But will you be able to go down the stairs?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p632">— I'm going to go...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p633">— As you wish.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p634">She went out on the dvornik's heels. He immediately went to examine the tip of the boot and the fringes:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p635">"There are stains, but they are not very visible: the mud and the friction have made the color disappear. Someone who does not already know the thing would see nothing. Therefore, Nastasia, from where she was, could not have noticed anything, thank God!" Then, with a trembling hand, he opened the envelope and began to read; he read for a long time and finally understood. It was a summons drawn up in the usual form: the district police commissioner invited Raskolnikov to appear at his office today at nine thirty.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p636">"But when did it happen? I have nothing to do with the police! And why today?" he asked himself, in a state of painful anxiety. "Lord, let it end as soon as possible!" As he was about to kneel down and pray, he began to laugh, not at the prayer, but at himself. He began to dress quickly.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p637">“I am lost, well, so much the worse, I don't care! I'm going to put on this boot!… After all, thanks to the dust of the road, the traces will be seen less and less.” But as soon as he had it on his foot, seized with fear and disgust, he suddenly pulled it off.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p638">Then, reflecting that he had no other boot, he put it on again with a fresh laugh.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p639">— "All this is conditional, all this is relative, there are, at most, presumptions and nothing else"; this idea, to which he clung without conviction, did not prevent him from trembling all over his body.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p640">— "Well, now I'm shod; I've finally managed it!" At that instant his hilarity gave way to dejection.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p641">"No, it's beyond my strength..." he thought. His legs were buckling.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p642">“It's from fear,” he thought to himself.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p643">The heat gave him a migraine.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p644">"It is a trap! They have resorted to cunning to lure me there, and when I am there, they will suddenly unmask their batteries," he continued to himself, approaching the stairs.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p645">— “The worst of it is that I am like a madman… I may say something foolish… ”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p646">On the stairs he thought that the things he had stolen from the old woman were very badly hidden under the tapestry.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p647">"Perhaps they have sent for me on purpose to be able to search here in my absence," he thought. But he was so desperate, he accepted his loss with such cynicism, if one can speak thus, that this apprehension scarcely stopped him for a minute.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p648">"Provided only that it be soon over!..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p649">Arriving at the corner of the street he had taken the day before, he cast a furtive and anxious glance in the direction of<i class="calibre4">the house</i>… But at once he turned his eyes away.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p650">"If they question me, I may confess," he thought as he approached the police station.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p651">The police station had been moved recently to the fourth floor of a house a quarter of a verst from his home. Before the police had moved into this new location, the young man had once had business with them; but it was for an unimportant matter, and it had been a long time ago. Entering the gateway, he saw to the right a staircase down which a peasant was descending, holding a book in his hand: “This must be a dvornik; consequently, the office is there.” And he went up at random. He did not want to ask anyone for information.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p652">"I'll go in, I'll kneel down and tell everything," he thought, as he climbed to the fourth floor.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p653">The staircase was narrow, steep, and dripping with dirty water. On all four floors, the kitchens of all the apartments opened onto this staircase, and they were open almost all day. So one was suffocated by the heat; one saw dvorniks going up and down with their books under their arms, police officers, and various individuals of both sexes who had business with the police station. The door of the office was also wide open.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p654">Raskolnikov entered and stopped in the anteroom, where some moujiks were waiting. There, as in the staircase, it was stiflingly hot; moreover, the room, freshly painted, exhaled a nauseating smell of oil. After waiting a moment, the visitor decided to go into the next room. It was a series of small, low rooms. The young man was becoming more and more impatient to know what he was to do. No one paid any attention to him. In the second room, clerks were working, dressed only a little better than he was. All these people had a rather strange air. He addressed one of them.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p655">— What do you want?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p656">He showed the summons sent by the police station.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p657">"Are you a student?" asked the clerk, after glancing at the paper.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p658">— Yes, a former student.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p659">The clerk examined his interlocutor, without any curiosity, however. He was a man with disheveled hair who seemed to be dominated by an obsession.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p660">"There is nothing to learn from him, because everything is the same to him," Raskolnikov said to himself.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p661">"Address yourself to him, the head of the chancellery," the scribe said, pointing to the last room.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p662">Raskolnikov entered. This room (the fourth) was narrow and crowded. Here were people dressed a little more neatly than those he had just seen. Among the visitors were two ladies. One of them was in mourning. Her dress denoted poverty. Sitting opposite the head of the chancellery, she wrote something under the dictation of this official.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p663">The other lady was very plump, with a very red face and a most luxurious toilette; she wore, in particular, a brooch of extraordinary dimensions on her breast; this person stood a little apart, in an expectant attitude. Raskolnikoff handed his paper to the head of the chancellery. The latter cast a rapid glance at it, said, "Wait a little," and resumed the course of his dictation to the lady in mourning.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p664">The young man breathed more freely. "Surely, that is not why I was called!" Gradually, he regained his courage, or at least he tried as much as possible to cheer himself up.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p665">"The slightest stupidity, the slightest imprudence would be enough to betray me! Hum... it's a pity there's no air here, he added, it's stuffy... My head is spinning more than ever... and my mind is doing the same..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p666">He felt a terrible malaise in his whole being and feared that he would not be able to remain master of himself. He tried to fix his mind on some completely indifferent object, but he did not succeed very well. His attention was exclusively captivated by the head of the chancellery; he was trying to decipher the face of this employee. He was a young man of twenty-two, whose swarthy and mobile face seemed older than his age. Dressed with the elegance of a little master, he had his hair parted on the occiput by an artistically made part; a quantity of rings shone on his very well-groomed fingers, and gold chains coiled on his vest. To a foreigner who was there, he even said two words in French, and he got along very well.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p667">"Louise Ivanovna, sit down," he said to the lady in full dress, who was still standing as if she did not dare to sit down, although there was a chair beside her.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p668">—<i class="calibre4">Thank you.</i>"Yes," she said, and sat down, her skirts, impregnated with perfume, billowing out with a slight rustle. Her dress of light blue silk, trimmed with white lace, spread out around her chair and took up nearly half the room. But the lady seemed ashamed of smelling so good and taking up so much space. She smiled with a look that was both timid and impudent; yet her anxiety was evident.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p669">The lady in mourning finally got up, having finished her business. Suddenly an officer with very bold manners entered with a noise, who walked by shaking his shoulders at every step; he threw his cockade-decorated cap on the table and took a seat on a chair.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p670">On seeing him, the lady in the rich dress rose quickly and bowed with a special respect, but the officer paid no attention to her, and she did not dare sit down again in his presence. This person was the assistant to the police commissioner; he had long reddish moustaches, arranged horizontally, and extremely fine features, but otherwise not very expressive and indicating little more than a certain impudence. He looked at Raskolnikov sideways and not without some indignation: however modest our hero's bearing, his attitude contrasted with the poverty of his dress. Forgetting prudence, the young man so boldly sustained the officer's gaze that the latter was offended.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p671">"What do you want?" he cried, astonished, no doubt, that such a barefooted man did not lower his eyes before his gaze, charged with lightning.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p672">“I was summoned… I was called,” stammered Raskolnikov.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p673">“It's the student who's being asked for money,” said the head of the chancellery, tearing himself away from his papers.</p>

<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p675">— Read!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p676">“Money? What money?” thought the young man, “but… so it's not for that!” And he trembled with joy. He felt an immense, inexpressible relief.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p677">But what time had you been told to come, sir? cried the lieutenant, whose ill-humour was increasing.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p678">— You were summoned at nine o'clock, and now it is more than eleven o'clock!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p679">"I was given this paper a quarter of an hour ago," Raskolnikov replied quickly, also seized by a sudden anger, to which he was even giving himself up with a certain pleasure.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p680">— Sick, with a fever, it's already very kind of me to have come!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p681">— Don't shout!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p682">— I am not shouting, I am speaking very calmly, it is you who are shouting; I am a student, and I do not allow anyone to take that tone with me.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p683">This reply so irritated the officer that, at first, he could not utter a word; inarticulate sounds alone escaped his lips. He leaped from his seat.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p684">— Silence! You are in court. Don't be insolent, sir.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p685">“You are at the trial, too,” Raskolnikov said violently, “and, not content with shouting, you are smoking a cigarette; consequently, you are missing us all.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p686">He spoke these words with an inexpressible satisfaction.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p687">The head of the chancellery looked at the two interlocutors with a smile. The fiery lieutenant was speechless for a moment.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p688">"That is none of your business!" he replied at last, affecting to speak very loudly to hide his embarrassment.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p689">— Make the declaration that is asked of you, that's all! Show him, Alexander Grigorievitch. There are complaints against you! You don't pay your debts! Here's a bold falcon!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p690">But Raskolnikov was no longer listening to him; he had seized the paper eagerly, impatient to discover the answer to this riddle. He read it once, twice, and did not understand.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p691">"What is it?" he asked the chief of the chancellery.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p692">— It is a bill of exchange for which you are being sued. You must either pay it, with all the costs, fines, etc., or declare in writing when you will be able to pay. At the same time, you must promise not to leave the capital, not to sell or hide your assets until you have paid. As for the creditor, he is free to sell your property and treat you according to the letter of the law.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p693">— But I… I owe nothing to anyone!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p694">— It is not our business. A bill of exchange has been handed over to us, which you signed nine months ago to Madame Zarnitzine, widow of a college assessor, and which Madame Zarnitzine has passed on to the court councillor Tchebaroff. We have therefore called you in to receive your statement.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p695">"But she is my landlady!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p696">— And what does it matter if she is your landlady?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p697">The chief of the chancellery looked at him with a smile of indulgent pity, and at the same time of triumph, at this novice who was going to learn at his own expense the procedure used against debtors. But what did the bill of exchange matter to Raskolnikoff now? What did the claim of his landlady matter to him? Was it worth his while to worry about it, or even to pay any attention to it? He was there reading, listening, answering, sometimes asking questions, but he did all this in a mechanical way. The happiness of feeling safe, the satisfaction of having escaped an imminent danger, — that was what, at this moment, filled his whole being.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p698">For the moment, all concern for the future, all worry was far from him. It was a moment of full, immediate, purely instinctive joy. But even then a storm broke out in the police station. The lieutenant had not yet digested the affront to his prestige, and his wounded self-esteem was obviously seeking revenge. So he suddenly began to maltreat the "beautiful lady" who, since he had entered, had not ceased to look at him with a very stupid smile.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p699">— And you, you hussy, he shouted at the top of his voice (the lady in mourning had already left), what happened at your place last night? What? You're causing a scandal all over the street again! Always fighting and drunken scenes! Do you want to be sent to prison? Come on, I told you, I warned you ten times that on the eleventh I would lose my patience! But you are incorrigible!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p700">Raskolnikov himself let the paper he was holding fall and looked at the beautiful lady with an astonished air, who was being treated with so little ceremony. However, he soon understood what it was about, and this story began to amuse him. He listened with pleasure and felt a violent desire to laugh ... All his nerves were very agitated.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p701">"Ilia Petrovitch!" said the head of the chancellery, but he at once recognized that his intervention at that moment would be inopportune: he knew by experience that when the fiery officer was thus launched, there was no stopping him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p702">As for the beautiful lady, the storm that had been unleashed on her head had at first made her tremble; but, strange to say, as she heard herself abused more and more, her face took on a more amiable expression, and she put more seduction into the smiles she did not cease to address to the terrible lieutenant. At every moment she made curtsies and waited impatiently for permission to say a word.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p703">"There was no noise or brawling at my house, sir," she hastened to say, as soon as she had found an opportunity to speak (she spoke Russian fluently, though with a very pronounced German accent), "there was no scandal. This man came in drunk, and asked for three bottles; then he began to play the piano with his foot, which is rather improper in a respectable house, and he broke the piano strings. I told him that it was not done; then he seized a bottle and began to strike everyone with it. I immediately called Karl, the dvornik; he struck Karl in the eyes; he did the same to Henriette, and he gave me five blows on the cheek. It is disgraceful to behave in such a way in a respectable house, sir."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p704">I called for help; he opens the window, which looks out onto the canal, and squeals like a little pig. Isn't that shameful? How can one go and stand at the window and squeal like a little pig? Foui-foui-foui! Karl, in pulling him back by the collar to make him leave the window, did, it is true, tear off one of the tails of his coat. Then he demanded fifteen roubles in compensation for the damage to his clothing. And I paid him five roubles out of my own pocket for that tail, Captain. It was this ill-bred visitor, Captain, who made all the fuss!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p705">— Come, come, enough! I have already told you, I have repeated…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p706">“Ilia Petrovitch!” said the head of the chancellery again, in a significant tone. The lieutenant threw a quick glance at him and saw him slightly nod his head</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p707">...Well, as for you, here is my last word, respectable Louise Ivanovna, continued the lieutenant:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p708">— If there is ever another scandal in your respectable house, I will have you thrown into jail, as they say in the grand style. Do you understand? Now you can go, but I will keep an eye on you, be careful!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p709">With a hurried amiability, Louise Ivanovna began to bow in all directions; but, while she was retreating backward toward the door, still bowing, she ran into the back of a handsome officer, with a fresh, open face, and a pair of magnificent, thick, blond whiskers. It was the police captain, Nikodim Fomitch himself. Louise Ivanovna hastened to bow down to the ground, and left the office with a little skipping step.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p710">"Thunder and lightning again, and a storm, a hurricane!" said Nikodim Fomitch, in a friendly tone, to his assistant. "You have been getting angry again, and have been scolding. I heard you from the stairs."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p711">"But how is that?" said Ilya Petrovitch, carelessly, as he moved his papers to another table; "here is a gentleman, a student, or rather an ex-student, who does not pay his debts, issues bills of exchange, refuses to leave his lodgings; people constantly complain of him, and this gentleman is offended because I light a cigarette in his presence! Before finding that he is being treated with disrespect, should he not respect himself more? Look at him; is he not well-dressed, and does he not look like a man who deserves respect?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p712">"Poverty is not a vice, my friend, but what! We know well, powder, that you are easily annoyed. No doubt, something in his way of being will have offended you, and you yourself will not have been able to contain yourself," continued Nikodim Fomitch, addressing Raskolnikoff in a friendly tone, "but you were wrong: he is an ex-cel-lent man, I assure you, only he is lively, carried away! He gets excited, he gets excited, and when he has thrown his fire, that's it, there is only a heart of gold! In the regiment, he was nicknamed: "the lieutenant powder" ...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p713">"And what a regiment it was!" cried Ilia Petrovitch, very sensitive to the delicate flatteries of his superior, but still sulky.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p714">Raskolnikov suddenly wanted to tell them all something extraordinarily pleasant.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p715">“Pardon me, captain,” he began in the most unconstrained tone, addressing himself to Nikodim Fomitch, “put yourself in my place… I am ready to apologize to him, if I have done him any wrong. I am a sick, poor, miserable student. I have left the university because I am now without means of support; but I am expecting money… My mother and sister live in the province of… They will send me funds, and I… I will pay. My landlady is a good woman; but as I no longer give lessons, and have not paid her for four months, she has got angry and refuses even to send me dinner… I don't understand this! So she demands that I should pay this bill of exchange now: can I do it? Judge for yourself…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p716">“But that is not our business,” observed the head of the chancellery again.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p717">"Allow me, allow me, I am quite of your opinion; but let me explain," Raskolnikov went on, still addressing Nikodim Fomitch and not the chief of the office; he was also trying to attract the attention of Ilya Petrovitch, though the latter affected to be contemptuously ignoring him and seemed to be occupied with his papers; "let me tell you that I have been living with her for nearly three years, since I came from the province, and at first... after all, why should I not confess it?... at first I promised to marry her daughter, I gave her my word of honor... She was a young girl... besides, she was very pretty... though I was not in love with her... in short, I was young, I mean that my landlady then gave me credit, and I led a life... I was very light-headed..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p718">"We are not asking you to go into those intimate details, sir, and we have no time to listen to them," Ilia Petrovitch interrupted rudely; but Raskolnikov continued with warmth, though it suddenly became extremely painful for him to speak:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p719">“Allow me, however, to tell you in my turn how the matter happened, though I admit with you that it is useless. A year ago, that young lady died of typhus; I remained a tenant of Madame Zarnitzine, and when my landlady went to live in the house where she now lives, she said to me in a friendly way that she had every confidence in me, but that nevertheless she would be glad if I would give her a bill for one hundred and fifteen roubles, the amount of my debt. Allow me: she positively assured me that once in possession of this paper, she would continue to give me credit as much as I wanted, and that never, never—such were her own words—would she put this bill into circulation. And now that I have lost my lessons, now that I have nothing to eat, she demands payment of this bill of exchange. What can I say to that?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p720">“All these pathetic details, sir, are none of our business,” Ilia Petrovitch insolently replied, “you must give us the declaration and the pledge that have been asked of you; as for the story of your love and all these tragic commonplaces, we have no use for them.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p721">"Oh, you are hard," murmured Nikodim Fomitch, who had seated himself at his desk and had also begun to sign papers. He seemed to feel a certain shame.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p722">"Write, then," said the head of the chancellery to Raskolnikov.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p723">“What to write?” asked the other in a brutal tone.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p724">— I will dictate to you.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p725">Raskolnikov thought he noticed that, since his confession, the head of the chancellery had taken a more disdainful tone with him; but, strangely, he had suddenly become completely indifferent to the opinion that could be held of him, and this change had taken place in the blink of an eye, instantly. If he had wanted to think a little, he would probably have been surprised to have been able, a minute earlier, to talk like this with the police officials and even to force them to listen to his confidences. Now, on the contrary, if, instead of being full of policemen, the room had suddenly been filled with his dearest friends, he would probably not have found a single human word to say to them, so much had his heart suddenly emptied.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p726">He felt only the painful impression of an immense isolation. It was not the confusion of having made Ilia Petrovitch a witness of his outpourings, it was not the insolent haughtiness of the officer that had suddenly produced this revolution in his soul. Oh! what did his own baseness matter to him now? What did the haughty airs, the lieutenants, the bills of exchange, the police offices, etc., etc., matter to him? If at that moment he had been condemned to be burned alive, he would not have stirred; he would scarcely have listened to the sentence pronounced.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p727">A wholly new and unprecedented phenomenon was taking place within him. He understood, or rather — a hundred times worse — he felt in his whole being that he was now cut off from human communion, that any sentimental outburst like the one he had just had, indeed, any conversation whatsoever, was forbidden him, not only with these people from the police station, but with his closest relatives. He had never before experienced such a cruel sensation.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p728">The head of the Chancellery began to dictate to him the formula of the declaration used in such cases: “I cannot pay, I promise to pay on such and such a date, I will not leave the city, I will not make any sale or transfer of my property, etc.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p729">But you cannot write, the pen trembles in your hand, observed the head of the chancellery, who was looking at Raskolnikov with curiosity.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p730">— Are you ill?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p731">— Yes… my head is spinning… go on!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p732">— But that is all; sign.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p733">The head of the chancellery took the paper and turned to the other visitors.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p734">Raskolnikov returned the pen, but instead of leaving, he leaned on the table and buried his head in his hands. He felt the same torment as if a nail had been driven into his sinciput. A strange idea suddenly came to him: to get up at once, approach Nikodim Fomitch and tell him the whole story of the previous day, everything to the last detail, then go with him to his apartment and show him the objects hidden in the hole in the tapestry. This project so seized his mind that he had already risen to carry it out.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p735">— "Wouldn't it be better to think about it for a minute?" he thought for a moment.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p736">"No, it is better to act on inspiration, to shake off this burden as soon as possible!" But suddenly he was rooted to the spot: a lively conversation was taking place between Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, which reached Raskolnikov's ears.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p737">"It is impossible; they will both be released. In the first place, there is nothing but improbabilities in the whole affair; just think: if they had committed the crime, why should they have called the dvornik? To denounce themselves? Or by cunning? No, that would be too cunning! Besides, the student Pestriakoff was seen by the two dvorniks and by a tradeswoman near the gate at the very moment he entered the house; he came with three friends who left him at the gate, and, before going away, his friends heard him ask the dvorniks where the old woman lived. Would he have asked that question if he had come with such a design? As for Koch, he spent half an hour at the jeweler's on the ground floor before going to the old woman's; it was just a quarter to eight when he left him to go up to the fourth floor. Now, examine..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p738">“But, allow me, there is something in their words that is not explained: they themselves affirm that they knocked and the door was closed; but three minutes later, when they returned with the dvornik, the door was open!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p739">"Here is where the hare lies: it is beyond doubt that the murderer was in the old woman's lodgings and had locked himself in; they would have found him for sure, if Koch had not made the mistake of going himself to fetch the dvornik. It was during that time that the murderer managed to slip into the staircase and slip under their noses. Koch makes great signs of the cross: "Ah! if I had stayed there, he said, he would have suddenly come out and killed me with his axe." He wants to blackmail a<i class="calibre4">Te Deum</i>, — hey! hey!…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p740">— And no one even saw the murderer?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p741">“But how could they have seen him? That house is the Ark of Noah,” observed the head of the chancellery, who was listening to the conversation from his seat.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p742">"The case is clear, the case is clear!" repeated Nikodim Fomitch with animation.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p743">“No,” said Ilya Petrovitch, “the matter is very obscure.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p744">Raskolnikov took his hat and went to the door, but he did not reach the door…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p745">When he came to, he found himself sitting on a chair; someone on his right was supporting him; on his left someone was holding a yellow glass filled with yellow water; Nikodim Fomitch, standing in front of him, was gazing at him fixedly; the young man stood up.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p746">"Well, are you ill?" asked the police commissioner in a rather stiff tone.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p747">"Just now, when he wrote his declaration, he could scarcely hold the pen," said the chief of the chancellery, as he sat down again at his desk and began to examine his papers.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p748">"And have you been ill long?" cried Ilia Petrovitch from his place, also turning over papers. Of course he had, like the others, approached Raskolnikov when he had fainted, but seeing him come to himself, he had immediately returned to his place.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p749">"Since yesterday," stammered the young man.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p750">— But yesterday you left your house?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p751">— Yes.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p752">— Ill?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p753">— Yes.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p754">— At what time?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p755">— Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p756">— And where did you go? Allow me to ask you.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p757">— In the street.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p758">— Short and clear.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p759">Pale as a sheet, Raskolnikov had given these answers in a brief, jerky tone; his black, fiery eyes had not lowered before the lieutenant's gaze.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p760">"He can hardly stand on his feet, and you..." Nikodim Fomitch wanted to say.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p761">"Never mind!" answered Ilia Petrovich enigmatically.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p762">The police commissioner wanted to add something more; but, casting his eyes on the chief of the chancellery, he met the gaze of that functionary fixed upon him, and held his peace. All were silent suddenly, which was not without its strangeness.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p763">"Well, that's all right," said Ilia Petrovitch at last; "we won't keep you."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p764">Raskolnikov withdrew; he had not yet left the room when the conversation had resumed, lively and animated, between the policemen. Above all the others was the voice of Nikodim Fomitch asking questions ... In the street, the young man regained his senses completely.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p765">"They are going to make a search, an immediate search!" he repeated, as he hurried towards his home; "the brigands! they have suspicions!" His fear of a moment ago seized him again from head to foot.</p>
