<h2 class="calibre7" id="h211">IV</h2>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p966">The new arrival was a tall, stout man of twenty-seven, with a puffy, pale, and carefully shaven face. His hair was almost white and stood straight up on his head. He wore glasses, and on the index finger of his thick hand glittered a large gold ring. It was evident that he liked to be comfortable in his clothes, which were, however, of a solid elegance. He wore a loose overcoat of light cloth and wide, light-colored summer trousers. His linen was impeccable, and a heavy gold watch chain dangled from his vest. There was something slow and phlegmatic in his movements, despite the efforts he made to appear at ease. Moreover, in spite of his self-control, pretension continually peeped out in his manners. All his acquaintances found him insufferable, but made great account of him as a doctor.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p967">"I've been to your place twice, my friend," cried Razumihin. "You see, he's come to his senses!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p968">"I see, I see; well, how do we feel today, eh?" asked Zosimov, looking attentively at Raskolnikov.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p969">At the same time, he sat down at the end of the sofa, near the feet of the patient, trying to find a place there large enough for his enormous person.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p970">"But he is still hypochondriacal," Razumihin continued; "just now, when we were changing his linen, he almost cried."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p971">"That is understandable; we could do that later, there was no need to upset him... The pulse is excellent. We still have a slight headache, don't we?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p972">"I am quite well, quite well!" said Raskolnikov irritably. As he said this he suddenly raised himself on the sofa, and his eyes flashed; but a second later he fell back on the pillow and turned to the wall. Zosimov watched him attentively.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p973">"Very well… nothing of particular note…," he said carelessly.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p974">— Has he eaten anything?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p975">The meal the patient had eaten was described, and they asked what he could be given.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p976">But he can have anything he likes… soup, tea… Of course, mushrooms and cucumbers are forbidden to him; he must not eat beef, either, nor… But that is superfluous chatter…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p977">— He exchanged a glance with Razumikhin.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p978">— No more potions, no more medicine, and tomorrow I will come to see… We could have done it today… Come, that's good…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p979">Tomorrow evening, I'll take her for a walk, Razumikhin decided.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p980">— We shall go together to the Yussupov Garden and then to the Crystal Palace.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p981">— Tomorrow might be a little early, but a little outing… Besides, we'll see by then.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p982">"What vexes me is that I am giving a party just two steps from here, and I should like him to be with us, even if he has to lie on a sofa! Will you come?" Razumihin suddenly asked Zosimov. "You promised, don't go back on your word."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p983">— All right, but I won't be able to come until quite late. Are you having a party?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p984">— Oh! nothing at all; there will be only tea, brandy, herrings, and a pie. It is a little gathering of friends.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p985">— Who will be your guests?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p986">— Friends, young men, and an old uncle of mine who has come to Petersburg on business. He arrived only yesterday, and we only see each other once every five years.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p987">“What is he doing?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p988">"He has vegetated all his life in a district where he was a postmaster... he draws a small pension, he is sixty-five years old, it is not even worth talking about... I love him, however. Porphyry Petrovich, the district attorney, will be at my place... a jurist. But you know him, by the way...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p989">— Is he also your relative?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p990">— Very far away. But why do you frown? Because you had a quarrel one day, you are in a position not to come?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p991">"Oh! I don't care much about him..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p992">“That's the best you can do. In short, I'll have students, a professor, a clerk, a musician, an officer; Zametov…”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p993">“Tell me, I beg you, what you or he” — Zosimoff indicated Raskolnikov with a nod — “can have in common with a Zametov.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p994">"Well, yes, if you want me to tell you, there is something in common between Zamétoff and me: we have undertaken a business together."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p995">"I should be curious to know what."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p996">— But it is always about the house painter… We are working to secure his release. At present, however, it will go all by itself. The case is now perfectly clear! Our intervention will only serve to hasten the denouement.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p997">— What painter are you talking about?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p998">"What, haven't I told you about it already? Ah! that's true, I only told you the beginning. Well, it's about the murder of the old pawnbroker. Well, they arrested the painter as the author of the crime."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p999">“Yes, before your story, I had already heard of this murder, and even the case interests me… to a certain extent… I read something about it in the newspapers. Ah! there it is…”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1000">“They've killed Elizabeth, too!” said Nastasia, suddenly addressing Raskolnikov.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1001">She had not left the room, and, standing near the door, was listening to the conversation.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1002">“Elizabeth?” the sick man mumbled in a voice almost inaudible.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1003">— Yes, Elizabeth, the vendor in the toilet, didn't you know her? She used to come down here. She even made you a shirt.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1004">Raskolnikov turned to the wall and fixed his eyes with all the intensity of his will upon one of the little white flowers in the paper that covered the wall. He felt his limbs growing numb, but he did not try to move, and his eyes remained obstinately fixed on the little flower.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1005">"Well, what about the painter who's involved in the case? I suppose they've found some evidence against him?" Zosimoff said, interrupting Nastasia's chatter with marked impatience. She sighed and fell silent.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1006">— Yes, but charges that are not charges, and that is precisely what we must prove! The police are on the wrong track here, as they were already wrong at the beginning when they suspected Koch and Pestriakoff! No matter how disinterested one is in the matter, one feels revolted at seeing an investigation so stupidly conducted! Pestriakoff may come to my place tonight... By the way, Rodia, you know this story, it happened before your illness, just the day before the day you fainted at the police station while they were talking about it...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1007">Zosimoff looked curiously at Raskolnikov, who did not stir.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1008">“I shall have to keep an eye on you, Razumihin,” observed the doctor. “You are getting yourself into a pretty mess over a matter that does not concern you.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1009">It may be so, but never mind! We will save that unhappy man from the clutches of justice! cried Razumihin, striking the table with his fist.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1010">“It is not the blunders of these people that irritate me most: it is permissible to make mistakes, error is excusable because it leads to the truth. No, what annoys me is that, while they are making mistakes, they continue to believe themselves infallible. I esteem Porphyre, but… Listen, do you know, for example, what confused them at first? The door was closed: but when Koch and Pestriakoff arrived with the dvornik, it was open: therefore Koch and Pestriakoff are the murderers! That is their logic!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1011">“Don't get excited. We had to arrest them. By the way, I met this Koch. It seems he had business dealings with the old woman. He bought back the things she couldn't pay for?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1012">"Yes, he is a swindler, a shady character! He also buys back bills of exchange. His misfortune does not move me in any way. I am angry at the idiotic actions of an outdated procedure ... It is time to open a new path here and to give up a routine that has had its day. Only psychological data can put you on the right track. "We have the facts!" they say. But facts are not everything; the way they are interpreted is at least half the success of an investigation!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1013">— And you, can you interpret the facts?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1014">“You see, it is impossible to remain silent when one feels, when one has the intimate conviction that one could help to discover the truth, if… Well!… Do you know the details of the case?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1015">“You told me about a house painter: I'm still waiting for his story.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1016">Well, listen. The morning after the murder, while the police were still investigating Koch and Pestriakoff, despite their perfectly categorical explanations, suddenly a most unexpected incident arose. A certain Douchkine, a peasant who runs a tavern opposite the house of the crime, brought a box containing gold earrings to the police station, and he told a whole story: "The night before last, a little after eight o'clock," note this coincidence!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1017">“Nikolai, a painter who frequents my establishment, came to ask me to lend him two rubles on the earrings contained in this little box. To my question: Where did you get this? he replied that he had picked it up on the sidewalk. I did not ask him any more,” said Doukhonine, “and I gave him a small bill,” that is to say, a ruble, because I said to myself, if I do not take this object, someone else will take it, and it is better that it be in my hands: if someone comes to claim it, if I learn that it has been stolen, I will go and take it to the police.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1018">Of course, he was lying shamelessly when he said this; I know this Doukhine, he is a receiver of stolen goods, and when he stole a thirty-ruble item from Nikolai, he had no intention of turning it in to the police; he only decided to do so under the influence of fear. But let Doukhine continue his story:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1019">— “This peasant, whose name is Nikolai Dementieff, I have known since childhood; he is, like me, from the government of Riazan and the district of Zaraisk. Although not a drunkard, he sometimes drinks a little too much.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1020">"We knew that he was doing painting work in that house with Mitri, who is from his country. After receiving the small note, Nikolay drank two glasses in a row, exchanged his ruble for payment, and left, taking the change. I did not see Mitri with him at that hour. The next day, we heard that Alena Ivanovna and her sister Elizabeth Ivanovna had been killed with an axe. We knew them, and then I had a doubt about the earrings, because we knew that the old woman lent money on such objects. To clear up my suspicions, I went to that house without pretending anything, and first of all I asked if Nikolay was there. Mitri answered me that his comrade was celebrating the wedding: Nikolay had come home drunk at the first hour of the day, and after about ten minutes he had gone out again; since then, Mitri had not seen him again, and he was finishing the work alone.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1021">"The staircase leading to the victims' apartment also serves the apartment where the two workers work, this apartment is located on the second floor. Having learned all this, I said nothing to anyone, "it is Douchkine who speaks," but I gathered as much information as possible about the circumstances of the assassination, and I returned home, still preoccupied with the same doubt. Now, this morning, at eight o'clock, "that is, the day after the crime, you understand?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1022">— “I see Nikolay come into my establishment; he had been drinking, but he was not too drunk and could understand what was said to him. He sits down in silence on a bench.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1023">“When he arrived, there was only one customer in my tavern, a regular who was sleeping on another bench; I am not speaking of my two young boys.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1024">"Have you seen Mitréi?" I asked Nikolaï.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1025">“No,” he said, “I did not see him.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1026">— And you didn't come to work here?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1027">"I have not been here since the day before yesterday," he said.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1028">— But, last night, where did you sleep?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1029">— At the Sands, with the Kolomenskys.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1030">“And where did you get the earrings you brought me the other day?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1031">“I found them on a sidewalk,” he said with a strange expression, avoiding my eyes.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1032">“Did you hear that on the same evening, at about the same hour, something happened in the building where you were working?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1033">“No,” he said, “I knew nothing about it.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1034">"I tell him the facts, which he listens to with his eyes wide open. Suddenly I see him turn as white as a piece of chalk; he takes his hat and stands up. I want to hold him back:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1035">"Wait a bit, Nikolaï," I said, "won't you have a glass of something?" At the same time I made a sign to my boy to go and stand in front of the door, and I left my counter. But, guessing, no doubt, my intentions, he darted out of the house, took to his heels, and in an instant disappeared round a corner. From that moment I no longer doubted that he was guilty."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1036">"I should think so!" said Zosimoff.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1037">“Wait! Listen to the end! Naturally, the police began to look for Nikolai everywhere: they made sure of Doukhin and Mitreya; they searched their homes; they also turned everything upside down at the Kolomenskys'; but it was only the day before yesterday that Nikolai himself was arrested in an inn at the *** barrier, as a result of curious circumstances. Arriving at this inn, he had taken off his cross, which was silver, handed it to the owner, and ordered a chkalik <span class="superscript-rw"></span> <span class="superscript-rw"> <span class="ref-note-rw" id="rw-ref-note-5"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre3 pcalibre4 pcalibre pcalibre1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0010.html#rw-num-note-5">5</a></span> </span> <span class="superscript-rw"><p class="Standard">The calculation of probabilities is a vain science, and we must be wary of that obscure instinct we called common sense, which we asked to legitimize our conventions.</p></span> of brandy. A few minutes later, a peasant woman comes to milk the cows, and, looking through a crack in a shed next to the stable, she sees the poor devil trying to hang himself: he had made a noose in his belt, tied it to a joist in the ceiling, and, standing on a block of wood, was trying to put his neck in the noose…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1038">"At the cries of the woman, the people run up: "So this is what you spend your time doing?" — "Take me," he said, "to such a police station, I will confess everything."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1039">"His request is granted, and with all the honors due to his rank, he is taken to the police station indicated, that is, to our district. There, the usual interrogation begins:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1040">"Who are you? How old are you?" "Twenty-two years old," etc. Question: "While you were working with Mitri, did you see anyone in the staircase between such and such a time?" Answer: "People may have passed, but we didn't notice them." "And did you hear any noise?" "We didn't hear anything special." "But you, Nikolai, did you know that day that at such and such a time a certain widow and her sister had been killed and robbed?" "I knew nothing about it at all; I first heard about it the day before yesterday, in the tavern, from Afanasy Pavlitch." "And where did you get the earrings?" "I found them on the pavement." "Why didn't you go to work with Mitri the next day?" "Because I was celebrating." "Where did you celebrate?" "In different places." "Why did you run away from Doukhin's?" "Because I was afraid." "Of what were you afraid?" "I was afraid of being put on trial." "How could you be afraid of that if you don't feel guilty of anything?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1041">Well, you will believe it or not, Zosimoff, this question was asked and literally in these terms, I know it positively, I was given the textual report of the interrogation! Well! how do you find it?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1042">— But, after all, the proofs are there.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1043">It is not a question of the evidence at the moment, but of the question put to Nicolas, of the way the police understand human nature! Come, that's fine, let's leave it! In short, they tormented the poor man so much that he finally confessed:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1044">"I didn't find these earrings on the sidewalk, but in the apartment where I worked with Mitrei." "How did you make this discovery?" "Mitrei and I had been painting all day; it was eight o'clock, and we were going to leave, when Mitrei took a brush, passed it over my face, and ran away after smearing me like that.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1045">"I rush after him, run down the stairs four at a time, shouting like a madman; but just as I reach the bottom at full speed, I run into the dvornik and some gentlemen who were also there, I don't remember how many. The dvornik starts swearing at me, another dvornik also swears at me, the first one's wife comes out of her lodge and joins in. Finally a gentleman who was entering the house with a lady starts swearing at us, Mitka and me, because we were lying across the door and blocking the passage. I had grabbed Mitka by the hair, thrown him to the ground, and was punching him. He had also grabbed me by the hair and was hitting me as hard as he could while he was under me. We were doing this without malice, just for fun. Then Mitka broke away and ran out into the street, I ran after him, but I couldn't catch him and I returned to the apartment alone, because I had to put my things in order. While I was putting them in order, I was waiting for Mitka, I thought he would come back. And there, in the vestibule, in the corner, near the door, I step on something, I look: it was an object wrapped in paper. I unwrap the paper and find a box containing earrings... "</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1046">"Behind the door? She was behind the door? Behind the door?" Raskolnikov suddenly exclaimed, looking at Razumihin with horror, and making an effort to raise himself on the sofa.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1047">"Yes... well, what is it? What's the matter with you? Why are you like this?" said Razumihin, also getting up from his seat.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1048">"It's nothing!" Raskolnikov barely had the strength to say, and he fell back on the pillow and turned his face to the wall again.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1049">They all fell silent for a while.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1050">"He was half asleep, no doubt," said Razumihin at last, looking inquiringly at Zosimov; the latter made a slight negative motion with his head.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1051">"Well, go on," said the doctor, "what next?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1052">"You know the rest. As soon as he had the earrings in his hands, he forgot all about his work and Mitka; he put on his cap and went straight to Dushkin. As I told you, he got a rouble from the tavern-keeper, and told him a lie, saying he had found the box on the pavement. Then he went to the wedding. But he keeps to the same story about the murder: 'I know nothing about it,' he says, 'I only heard about it the day after.' 'But why did you hide yourself all this time?' 'Because I was afraid.' 'Why were you afraid?' 'Because I was afraid of being arrested.' That's all he says. Now, what do you think they'll make of it?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1053">"What do you want me to think? There is a presumption, perhaps debatable, but it exists nonetheless. There is a fact. Should they have given your house painter his freedom?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1054">— But they've actually charged him with murder! They have no doubts whatsoever…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1055">"Come, don't get excited. You forget the earrings. The same day, a few moments after the murder, earrings that were in the victim's chest were seen in Nicolas's hands: admit it yourself, one must necessarily ask how he got them. It is a question that the investigating magistrate cannot neglect to clarify."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1056">"How did he get them?" cried Razumihin. "How did he get them? Come, doctor, you are bound first of all to study the man; you have more than anyone else the opportunity of getting to the bottom of human nature, and yet you can't see the character of this man from all this, from the very fact that he has taken these three thousand roubles, and you think he is a thief! You are still in the dark as to the character of that man. How can you fail to see that the man is a lost soul, a man who has lost all sense of shame, a man who has lost his way in life, an unfortunate man who has no idea what he is doing, and who, moreover, has no one to help him, no one to put him on the right path, no one to make a man of him again? He has lost everything, he has lost himself, he has no one, and he is not fit to live. He has lost everything, he is a ruined man, but you are still trying to prove that he is a thief! What are you thinking of, doctor?"<i class="calibre4">a priori,</i>that all the statements made by him during his interrogations are the purest truth? He got the earrings exactly as he says. He stepped on the box, and he picked it up.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1057">“The purest truth! Yet he himself admitted that he had lied the first time.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1058">“Listen to me, listen attentively: the dvornik, Koch, Pestriakoff, the other dvornik, the first dvornik's wife, the merchant woman who was with her in the lodge at the time, the court counselor Krukoff, who had just gotten out of his carriage and was entering the house with a lady on his arm, all of them, that is, eight or ten witnesses, testify with one voice that Nicolas threw Dmitri to the ground, and, holding him under him, beat him with his fists, while Dmitri had grabbed his comrade by the hair and was returning the favor. They are lying across the door and blocking the passage; they are being cursed from all sides, and they, “like little children” (this is the exact expression of the witnesses), cry, quarrel, burst into laughter, and chase each other down the street, just as children would have done. Do you understand? Now, notice this: upstairs, lie two corpses that have not yet cooled, note that they were still warm when they were discovered.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1059">If the crime was committed by the two workers or by Nicolas alone, let me ask you a question: Can one understand such carelessness, such freedom of spirit in people who have just committed a murder followed by theft? Is there not incompatibility between these cries, these laughs, this childish struggle and the moral disposition in which the murderers should have found themselves? What! five or ten minutes after killing — for, I repeat, the bodies were found still warm — they leave without even closing the door of the apartment where their victims lie, and, knowing that people are going up to the old woman, they frolic under the carriage gate instead of fleeing as quickly as possible, they block the passage, they laugh, they attract general attention, as ten witnesses unanimously declare!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1060">“Of course, it is strange, it seems impossible, but…”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1061">There is no "but," my friend. I admit that the earrings, found in Nicolas's hands a few moments after the crime, constitute a serious material fact against him, a fact that is, moreover, explained in a plausible way by the accused's statements and, as such, subject to discussion," but it is also necessary to take into account the exculpatory facts, all the more so since these are "beyond discussion." Unfortunately, given the spirit of our jurisprudence, our magistrates are incapable of admitting that an exculpatory fact, based on a pure psychological impossibility, can destroy material charges, whatever they may be. No, they will never admit that, for the reason that they found the box and that the man wanted to hang himself, "something he would not have thought of if he had not felt guilty!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1062">— That is the capital question, and that is why I am getting excited! Do you understand?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1063">“Yes, I see that you are getting excited. Wait a little, there is something I forgot to ask you: what proves that the box containing the earrings was actually taken from the old woman?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1064">"That is proved," Razumihin muttered sullenly; "Koch has recognized the object, and has pointed out the man who pawned it. He has, moreover, proved conclusively that the box is his own."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1065">— Too bad. One more question: did anyone see Nicolas while Koch and Pestriakoff were going up to the fourth floor, and can his alibi not be established?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1066">"The fact is that no one saw him," answered Razumihin, in a tone of vexation, "that's the distressing part! Koch and Pestriakoff themselves did not see the workmen when they went up the stairs, and, besides, their evidence would not be of much value now. "We saw," they say, "that the door was open, and that there was probably work going on inside, but we did not pay much attention, and we don't remember whether there were any workmen in the room or not."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1067">— Hum! So all Nicolas's justification rests on the laughter and the blows he exchanged with his comrade. Well, that's a strong proof in support of his innocence, but... Allow me now to ask you how you account for the fact: assuming the accused's version to be true, how do you explain the discovery of the earrings?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1068">“How do I explain it? But what is there to explain here? The case is clear. At least, the path is clearly indicated in the investigation, and precisely indicated by the box. The real culprit dropped these earrings. He was upstairs when Koch and Pestriakoff knocked on the door; he had locked himself in. Koch made the mistake of going downstairs; then the murderer slipped out of the apartment and went down, too, since he had no other way to escape.
