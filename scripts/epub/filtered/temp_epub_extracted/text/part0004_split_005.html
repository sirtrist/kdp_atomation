<h2 class="calibre7" id="h219"><p class="Standard">V.</p></h2>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2011">Raskolnikov entered the magistrate's office with the air of a man who is doing his utmost to preserve his seriousness, but who is only succeeding with difficulty. Behind him walked Razumihin, awkwardly, red as a peony, his features distorted by anger and shame. The tall, lanky figure and the crestfallen expression of this big fellow were then sufficiently comical to justify his companion's hilarity. Porfiry Petrovitch, standing in the middle of the room, was looking inquiringly at the two visitors. Raskolnikov bowed to the master of the house, shook hands with him, and seemed to make a violent effort to stifle his desire to laugh while he was stating his name and occupation. But scarcely had he recovered his composure and uttered a few words, when, in the middle of the introduction, his eyes happened to meet Razumihin's. From that moment he could not restrain himself, and his seriousness gave place to a hilarity which was all the more boisterous because it had been so long suppressed. Razumihin unwittingly served his friend's purpose, for this "fit of laughter" put him into a rage which completed the impression of frank and natural gaiety.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2012">"Oh, the scoundrel!" he cried with a violent movement of his arm.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2013">This abrupt gesture had the effect of knocking over a small table on which was a glass that had contained tea.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2014">"But why damage the furniture, gentlemen? You are doing a disservice to the state!" cried Porfiry Petrovich gaily.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2015">Raskolnikoff laughed so much that for a few moments he forgot his hand in that of the examining magistrate; but it would have been unnatural to leave it there too long, so he withdrew it at the right moment, in order to keep up the appearance of his role. As for Razumihin, he was more confused than ever since he had knocked over a table and broken a glass; after considering the consequences of his outburst with a gloomy air, he went to the window and there, turning his back on the public, began to look out of the window without, however, seeing anything. Porphyry Petrovitch laughed out of politeness, but he was obviously waiting for an explanation. In a corner, on a chair, was sitting Zametov; at the appearance of the visitors, he had half risen and smiled slightly; however, he did not seem to be taken in by this scene and observed Raskolnikoff with particular curiosity. The latter had not expected to find the police officer there, whose presence caused him an unpleasant surprise.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2016">"Here is another thing to consider," he thought.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2017">"Excuse me, please," he began with simulated embarrassment. "Raskolnikov..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2018">"Come, come, you have given me great pleasure, you came in so pleasantly... Well, he won't even say hello?" added Porfiry Petrovich, nodding towards Razumihin.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2019">"I really don't know why he is angry with me. I only said to him on the way that he looked like Romeo, and... and I proved it to him, there was nothing more to it."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2020">"Swine!" cried Razumihin, without turning his head.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2021">"He must have had very serious reasons for taking this little joke so badly," observed Porfiry Petrovich, laughing.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2022">"That's the way with the examining magistrate, always probing!... Well, the devil take you all!" cried Razumihin, laughing himself, and he suddenly became quite cheerful again, and went up gaily to Porfiry Petrovich.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2023">"Enough of this nonsense! To our business: I present to you my friend Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, who has heard a great deal about you and wants to make your acquaintance; and then he has a little business to transact with you. Ah! Zametov! What chance brings you here? You know each other, then? How long have you known each other?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2024">"What does this mean again?" Raskolnikov asked himself with concern.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2025">Razumihin's question seemed to embarrass Zametov a little, but he recovered himself quickly.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2026">"It was yesterday at your house that we met," he said with a casual air.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2027">— Then the hand of God has done everything. Imagine, Porphyry, that last week he had expressed to me a very strong desire to be introduced to you, but it seems that you did not need me to get in touch with each other ... Do you have tobacco?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2028">Porphyry Petrovitch was in his morning negligee: dressing-gown, worn-out slippers, and very clean linen. He was a man of about thirty-five, of medium height, rather stout, and even slightly corpulent. He had neither beard nor moustache, and his hair was cropped very short. His large, round head presented a peculiar fulness in the region of the nape of the neck. His puffy, round, and somewhat pock-marked face was not without a certain vivacity, and even a certain cheerfulness, though the tint of his complexion was a sort of dingy yellow, which did not indicate robust health. One might have supposed that there was a touch of bonhomie in this face, if it had not been for the expression of the eyes, which, under their almost white lashes, seemed to be winking slyly and intelligently at some one. The expression of these eyes contradicted the rest of the face in a strange way. At first sight, the physical aspect of the examining magistrate presented some resemblance to that of a peasant, but this mask did not long deceive an attentive observer.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2029">As soon as he learned that Raskolnikov had a "small matter" to discuss with him, Porfiry Petrovich invited him to take a seat on the sofa, sat down at the other end, and placed himself at his disposal with the greatest eagerness. Usually, we feel a little embarrassed when a man we hardly know shows such curiosity to hear us; our embarrassment is even more acute if the subject we have to discuss turns out to be, in our own eyes, unworthy of the extreme attention we are being shown. Nevertheless, Raskolnikov, in a few short and precise words, clearly explained his business; he was even able, along the way, to observe Porfiry Petrovich quite well. He, on his side, did not take his eyes off him. Razumikhin, sitting opposite them, listened impatiently, and his eyes constantly went from his friend to the examining magistrate and back again.<i class="calibre4">vice versa</i>, which was a bit over the top.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2030">"The fool!" Raskolnikov muttered to himself.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2031">"We must make a statement to the police," replied Porfiry Petrovich with the most indifferent air.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2032">— You will explain that, informed of such an event, that is to say of this murder, you wish to make known to the examining magistrate in charge of this affair that such objects belong to you and that you wish to recover them… or… but, in any case, you will be written to.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2033">"Unfortunately," Raskolnikov said with feigned confusion, "I am far from being in funds at the moment... and my means do not even allow me to redeem these trifles... You see, I would like to limit myself for the moment to declaring that these objects are mine and that, when I have money..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2034">“That doesn't matter,” answered Porfiry Petrovich, who received this financial explanation coldly; “besides, you can, if you like, write to me directly, you will declare that, having learned of such and such a thing, you desire to inform me that such and such objects belong to you and that…”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2035">"Can I write this letter on ordinary paper?" interrupted Raskolnikov, still affecting to see only the financial side of the question.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2036">— Oh! on any paper!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2037">Porphyry Petrovitch uttered these words with a frank, mocking air, and made a little sign with his eyes to Raskolnikov. At least, the young man would have sworn that this wink was directed at him and betrayed the devil knew what ulterior motive. Perhaps, after all, he was mistaken, for it lasted scarcely the space of a second.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2038">"He knows!" he said to himself instantly.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2039">"Pardon me for having disturbed you for such a trifle," he continued, rather abashed, "these articles are worth in all five roubles, but their origin makes them particularly dear to me, and I confess I was very much disturbed when I learned..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2040">"That's why you were so upset yesterday when you heard me tell Zosimov that Porfiry was questioning the owners of the pawned articles!" Razumihin remarked with evident intention.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2041">That was too much. Raskolnikov could not contain himself and threw a flaming look of anger at the unfortunate chatterbox. Immediately afterwards he realized that he had been imprudent, and he tried to make amends.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2042">"You seem to be making fun of me, my friend," he said to Razumihin, affecting a lively vexation. "I admit that I may be worrying about things that are absolutely insignificant in your eyes; but that is no reason for you to look upon me as an egotistic and avaricious man: these trifles may not be without value to me. As I told you just now, this silver watch, which is worth a hundred and fifty roubles, is a present from my father, and I value it very highly. I am not a thief, and I don't want to be a thief. I want to be an honest man, and I want to be respected by everyone. I don't want to be a slave to anyone, and I don't want to be a slave to my own passions. I want to be master of myself, and I want to be master of my own life. I want to be a man, and I want to be respected by everyone."<i class="calibre4">peas</i>, is all that remains of my father. You may mock me, but my mother came to see me — so saying, he turned to Porphyry.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2043">— And if she knew, he continued, addressing Razumihin again in a voice as tremulous as possible, if she knew that I am no longer in possession of this watch, I swear to you she would be in despair. Women!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2044">“But not at all! That's not what I meant! You've completely misunderstood my thought!” protested Razumikhin, upset.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2045">"Is that all right? Is it natural? Have I not forced the note?" Raskolnikov asked himself anxiously. "Why did I say: women?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2046">"Ah! Your mother came to see you?" asked Porfiry Petrovich.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2047">— Yes.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2048">— When did she arrive?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2049">— Last night.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2050">The examining magistrate remained silent for a moment; he seemed to be thinking.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2051">“Your affairs could not in any case be lost,” he continued, in a calm and cold tone. “I have been expecting your visit for some time.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2052">As he said this, he quickly pushed the ashtray towards Razumihin, who was shaking the ashes of his cigarette mercilessly onto the carpet. Raskolnikov shivered, but the examining magistrate did not seem to notice, so busy was he in preserving his carpet.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2053">"How, you were expecting his visit? But did you know that he had engaged something there?" cried Razoumikbine.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2054">Without replying, Porphyry Petrovitch turned to Raskolnikov:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2055">— Your belongings: a ring and a watch, were found in her possession, rolled up in a piece of paper, and on that paper your name was legibly written in pencil with the date of the day she received these objects from you...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2056">"What a memory you have for all that!" said Raskolnikov with a forced smile, trying his best to look confidently at the examining magistrate; but he could not help adding abruptly:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2057">— I made this observation because, the owners of the pledged objects being doubtless very numerous, you must, it seemed to me, have difficulty remembering them all... Now, I see on the contrary that you do not forget one, and... and...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2058">“Weak! Fool! What need had I to add that?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2059">“But almost all have already made themselves known; you alone had not yet come,” replied Porphyry with an almost imperceptible nuance of mockery.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2060">— I was not very well.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2061">“I have heard it said. I was even told that you had been very ill. Even now you are pale…”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2062">"Not at all, I am not pale... on the contrary, I am feeling very well!" replied Raskolnikov in a tone that had suddenly become brutal and violent. He felt a rage boiling up in him that he could not control. "My anger will make me say something stupid!" he thought. "But why are they exasperating me?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2063">"He was not very well!" cried Razumihin. "That's a euphemism, for instance!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2064">“The truth is that until yesterday he was almost unconscious all the time… Can you believe it, Porphyry? Yesterday, barely able to stand on his feet, he took advantage of the moment when Zosimoff and I had just left him to get dressed, sneak out and go for a walk, God knows where, until midnight… in a state of complete delirium. Can you imagine such a thing? It is a most remarkable case!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2065">— Bah! really!<i class="calibre4">In a complete state of delirium?</i>said Porphyry Petrovitch, with the nod of the head peculiar to Russian peasants.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2066">"It's absurd!" he exclaimed, carried away by his anger. "Don't believe it! Besides, I don't need to tell you that, your conviction is made!" But Porfiry Petrovich seemed not to hear these strange words.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2067">“How could you have gone out if you had not been delirious?” Razumihin continued, growing heated. “Why did you go out? What for? And above all, what was the idea of sneaking out like that? Come, admit that you were not in your right mind! Now that all danger is past, I tell you so straight out!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2068">"They annoyed me extremely yesterday," said Raskolnikov, addressing the examining magistrate with a smile that resembled a challenge, "and, wishing to get rid of them, I went out to rent a lodging where they could not find me; I had taken a certain sum for that purpose. Mr. Zametov saw the money in my hands. Well! Mr. Zametov, was I in my right mind yesterday, or was I delirious? Judge our quarrel."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2069">He would have gladly strangled the policeman at that moment, who irritated him by his silence and the ambiguous expression in his eyes.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2070">"I thought you spoke very sensibly, and even with a great deal of finesse; only you were too irritable," said Zametov dryly.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2071">"And today," Porfiry Petrovich added, "Nikodim Fomitch told me that he saw you yesterday at a very late hour in the apartment of a government official who had just been run over by a carriage..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2072">"Well, that only confirms what I say!" Razumihin continued. "Did you not behave like a madman at the official's? You gave away all your money to pay for the funeral! I admit that you wished to help the widow, but you could have given her fifteen roubles, twenty at the most, and kept something for yourself: instead of that, you fling away all you have, your last twenty-five roubles!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2073">But perhaps I have found a treasure, what do you know! Yesterday, I was in a mood to be generous... Mr. Zametov here knows that I have found a treasure!... Forgive me for having bored you for half an hour with such idle chatter, he continued, his lips trembling, addressing Porphyry.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2074">“You are exasperated, aren't you?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2075">“What are you saying? On the contrary, on the contrary! If you knew how interested I am in you! I find you so curious to see and hear… I admit that I am delighted to have finally received your visit…”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2076">"Give us some tea," cried Razumihin. "We're parched."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2077">"Excellent idea!... But before tea, perhaps you would like something more substantial?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2078">— Save yourself!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2079">Porfiry Petrovitch went out to order tea. All sorts of thoughts were whirling in Raskolnikov's brain. He was very excited.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2080">"They don't even bother to pretend; they don't beat about the bush with me: that's the main point! Since Porfiry didn't know me at all, what did he talk about with Nikodim Fomitch? So they don't even bother to hide that they're on my tail like a pack of dogs! They spit in my face openly!" he said to himself, trembling with rage. Well! go ahead, but don't play with me like a cat with a mouse. It's impolite, Porfiry Petrovich, I may not allow that yet!... I will get up, I will throw the truth in your face, and you will see how I despise you!..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2081">He breathed with difficulty. "But what if all this existed only in my imagination? If it was a mirage? If I had misinterpreted things? Let us try to support our vile role and not go astray, like a starling, by blind anger! Would I lend them intentions they do not have? Their words have nothing extraordinary in themselves, that is what one can always say; but there must be hidden implications. Why did Porphyry simply say "at her place," when speaking of the old woman? Why did Zametov observe that I had spoken<i class="calibre4">with a great deal of finesse?</i>Why did they speak in that tone? Yes, it was that tone. How did Razumihin not notice it? That fool never notices anything! I'm feverish again! Did Porfiry wink at me just now, or was I deceived by an illusion? It's absurd, of course; why should he wink? Perhaps they want to irritate my nerves, to drive me to extremes? Or is it all a hallucination, or do they know?...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2082">"Even Zametov is insolent. He must have thought things over since yesterday. I knew he would change his mind! He is here as if he were at home, and he is here for the first time! Porfiry does not consider him a stranger, he sits with his back to him. These two men have become a pair of friends, and their relationship must have begun because of me! I am sure they were talking about me when we arrived!... Do they know about my visit to the old woman's apartment? I am eager to know!... When I said that I had gone out to rent a room, Porfiry did not take the bait... But I did well to say that: later, it may be useful!... As for the delirium, the examining magistrate does not seem to be interested in that... He is perfectly informed about how I spent my evening! He did not know about my mother's arrival!... And that witch, who had written the date of the engagement in pencil!... No, no, your affected assurance does not deceive me: so far, you have no facts, you are basing yourself on vague conjectures! Tell me one fact, if you can allege one against me! This visit I made to the old woman does not prove anything, it can be explained by delirium; I remember what I said to the workers and the dvornik... Do they know that I went there? I will not leave until I am sure about that! Why did I come? But now I am getting angry, that is what is to be feared! Ah! how irritable I am! After all, perhaps it is better that way: I remain in my role of sick man... He will harass me and drive me crazy. Why did I come?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2083">All these ideas flashed through his mind with the speed of lightning.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2084">After a moment, Porfiry Petrovitch returned. He seemed in very good spirits.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2085">“Yesterday, when I left your place, my friend, I really had a headache,” he began, addressing Razumihin with a gaiety he had not shown before, “but now it's passed…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2086">"Well, was the evening interesting? I left you at the best moment; to whom did the victory remain?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2087">— But to no one, naturally. They have argued to the best of their ability on their old theses.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2088">"Imagine, Rodya, that the discussion yesterday was about this question: Are there crimes or are there not? and what nonsense they spouted on this subject!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2089">“What is there so extraordinary about that?” said Raskolnikov, distractedly. “It is a social question, and not a new one at that.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2090">“The question was not formulated like that,” observed Porphyry.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2091">“Not quite like that, it's true,” Razumikhin immediately acknowledged, who had gotten carried away according to his habit.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2092">“Listen, Rodya, and tell us your opinion, I want it. Yesterday they drove me crazy, and I was still waiting for you, I promised them your visit… The socialists began by expounding their theory. You know what it consists of: crime is a protest against a badly organized social order — nothing more. When they said that, they said everything; they do not admit any other cause of criminal acts; for them, man is driven to crime by the irresistible influence of the environment and by it alone. This is their favorite phrase.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2093">— As to crime and its environment, said Porphyry Petrovitch, addressing Raskolnikov, I remember a work of yours which interested me greatly; I mean your article:<i class="calibre4">On crime…</i>I don't remember the title very well. I had the pleasure of reading it two months ago in the<i class="calibre4">Periodic speech</i>.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2094">— My article? in the<i class="calibre4">Periodic speech</i>? asked Raskolnikov in astonishment; in fact, six months ago, when I left the University, I wrote an article about a book, but I took it to the<i class="calibre4">Weekly Word</i>, and not to the<i class="calibre4">Periodic speech</i>.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2095">— And it was in this one that he was born.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2096">— In the meantime, the<i class="calibre4">Weekly Word</i>ceased to appear, that's how my article wasn't published then…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2097">— It is true, but by ceasing to appear, the<i class="calibre4">Weekly Word</i>has merged with the<i class="calibre4">Periodic speech</i>, and it was thus that two months ago this last journal published your article. You did not know that?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2098">Raskolnikov did not know this.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2099">— Well, you can go and collect the price of your copy! What a character you have, though! You live so retired that even the things that concern you directly do not come to your knowledge! That is a fact.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2100">"Bravo, Rodia! I didn't know that either!" cried Razumihin.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2101">— Today, I'll go and ask for the issue at the reading room! It's been two months since the article was published? On what date? Never mind, I'll look for it! What a farce! And he didn't say anything!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2102">— But how did you know the article was mine? I had signed it with an initial.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2103">— I learned it by chance, recently. The editor-in-chief is a friend of mine, and it was he who betrayed the secret of your anonymity… I was very interested in this article.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2104">— I was examining, I remember, the psychological state of the criminal during the commission of his crime.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2105">“Yes, and you were trying to demonstrate that the criminal, at the moment he commits his crime, is always a sick man. It is a very original point of view, but… it is not this part of your work that interested me the most; I noticed especially a thought that was at the end of the article and that, unfortunately, you were content to indicate in a somewhat too summary way… In a word, if you remember, you gave to understand that there are men on earth who can, or, to put it better, who have the absolute right to commit all sorts of guilty and criminal actions; men for whom, in a way, the law is not made.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2106">Raskolnikov smiled at this treacherous interpretation of his thought.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2107">"What? What? The right to commit crime? Didn't he mean that the criminal is driven to crime by the "irresistible influence of his environment"? Razumihin asked with a kind of anxiety.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2108">“No, no, it is not that,” replied Porphyry. “In the article in question men are divided into ‘ordinary' and ‘extraordinary'. The former must live in obedience and have no right to violate the law, since they are ordinary men; the latter have the right to commit all crimes and transgress all laws, for the reason that they are extraordinary men. Is that not what you say, if I am not mistaken?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2109">"But how? It is impossible that this is it!" Razumikhin stammered, stupefied.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2110">Raskolnikov smiled again. He had understood at once that they wanted to wring a confession of principles from him, and, remembering his article, he did not hesitate to explain it.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2111">"That is not quite it," he began in a simple and modest tone. "I admit, however, that you have reproduced my thought almost exactly; if you like, I will even say, very exactly" (he pronounced these last words with a certain pleasure). "Only, I did not say, as you make me say, that extraordinary people are absolutely obliged to commit all sorts of criminal actions. I even believe that the censor would not have allowed an article conceived in this sense to appear. Here is simply what I advanced: the extraordinary man has the right, not officially, but by himself, to authorize his conscience to cross certain obstacles, only in the case where the realization of his idea (which can sometimes be useful to all mankind) requires it. You claim that my article is not clear, I will try to explain it to you: perhaps I am not mistaken in supposing that this is your desire.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2112">In my opinion, if the inventions of Kepler and Newton, by reason of certain circumstances, could have become known only through the sacrifice of one, ten, a hundred, and a greater number of lives that would have been obstacles to these discoveries, Newton would have had the right, indeed, he would have been obliged to<i class="calibre4">delete</i>these ten, these hundred men, so that his discoveries would be known to the whole world. This, however, does not mean that Newton had the right to murder anyone he pleased or to commit thefts at the market every day.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2113">In the continuation of my article, I insist, I remember, on the idea that all the legislators and guides of humanity, beginning with the most ancient, to continue with Lycurgus, Solon, Mohammed, Napoleon, etc., that all, without exception, have been criminals, for in giving new laws, they have thereby violated the old ones, faithfully observed by society and transmitted by the ancestors; certainly they did not hesitate either before the shedding of blood, as soon as it could be useful to them.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2114">It is even to be remarked that almost all these benefactors and guides of the human race have been terribly sanguinary. Consequently, not only all great men, but all those who rise in any way above the common level, who are capable of saying something new, must, in virtue of their own nature, be necessarily criminals, — more or less, of course. Otherwise, it would be difficult for them to get out of the rut; as for remaining in it, they certainly cannot consent to it, and, in my opinion, their duty even forbids them.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2115">In a word, you see that so far there is nothing particularly new in my article. It has been said and printed a thousand times. As for my division of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I admit that it is a little arbitrary, but I leave aside the question of numbers, which I do not care about. I only believe that my thought is essentially correct. It amounts to saying that nature divides men into two categories: one inferior, that of ordinary men, a kind of material whose only mission is to reproduce beings like themselves; the other superior, comprising men who possess the gift or talent of making a new word heard in their environment. The subdivisions, of course, are innumerable, but the two categories have quite distinct distinctive features. The first generally includes conservatives, men of order, who live in obedience and love it. In my opinion, they are even obliged to obey, because it is their destiny and there is nothing humiliating for them in it. The second group consists exclusively of men who violate the law or tend, according to their means, to violate it. Their crimes are, of course, relative and of varying gravity. Most of them demand the destruction of what is in the name of what should be. But if, for their idea, they must shed blood, step over corpses, they can in conscience do both, - in the interest of their idea, of course, - note that. It is in this sense that my article recognizes their right to crime. (You remember that our starting point was a legal question.) Besides, there is no need to worry much: almost never does the mass grant them this right, it decapitates and hangs them (more or less), and by that it very justly fulfills its conservative mission until the day, it is true, when this same mass erects statues to the supplicants and venerates them (more or less). The first group is always the master of the present, the second group is the master of the future. One preserves the world and multiplies its inhabitants, the other moves the world and leads it to its goal. Both have absolutely the same right to exist, and - long live the eternal war, - until the New Jerusalem, of course!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2116">— So you believe in the New Jerusalem?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2117">"I believe it," Raskolnikov answered with great force, and during the whole of his long tirade he had kept his eyes lowered, obstinately looking at one spot on the carpet.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2118">— And… do you believe in God? Forgive me for my curiosity.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2119">"I believe it," repeated the young man, raising his eyes to Porphyre.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2120">— And… and to the resurrection of Lazarus?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2121">— Yes. Why do you ask me all this?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2122">— Do you believe in it literally?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2123">— Literally.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2124">— Excuse me for asking you these questions, they interested me. But, allow me; — I return to the subject we were talking about just now, — they are not always executed; there are some, on the contrary, who…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2125">— Who triumph during their lifetime? Oh, yes, it happens to a few, and then…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2126">— They are the ones who deliver the others to the torture?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2127">— If necessary, and, to tell the truth, that is the most frequent case. In general, your observation is full of accuracy.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2128">“I thank you. But tell me: how can one distinguish these extraordinary men from ordinary men? Do they bring certain signs with them at birth? I think that here a little more precision would be necessary, a more apparent delimitation, as it were: excuse this natural anxiety in a practical and well-intentioned man, but could they not, for example, wear a particular garment, some emblem?... For, admit it, if there is confusion, if an individual of one category imagines that he belongs to the other and sets out, according to your happy expression, to “remove all obstacles,” then...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2129">— Oh! that happens very often! This second remark is even more subtle than the first...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2130">— Thank you.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2131">“There is no need to be alarmed; but remember that the error is possible only in the first category, that is, in those whom I have called, perhaps very improperly, ‘ordinary' men. In spite of their innate tendency to obedience, many of them, by a play of nature, like to fancy themselves men of progress, ‘destroyers,' they believe themselves called to utter a ‘new word,' and this illusion is very sincere in them. At the same time, they usually do not notice the real innovators, they even despise them as people behind the times and lacking in elevation of mind. But, in my opinion, there can be no serious danger here, and you need not be uneasy, for they never go very far. Of course, they might sometimes be whipped for their error and put back in their place, but that is all; and here it is not even necessary to call in the executioner: they themselves administer the discipline, for they are very moral people; sometimes they render each other this service, sometimes they whip themselves with their own hands… They are seen to inflict various public penances, which is not without its edifying effect; in a word, you need not be concerned about them.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2132">"Well, at least on that side you have reassured me a little; but here is another thing that bothers me: tell me, please, are there many of these "extraordinary" people who have the right to slaughter others? Of course, I am quite ready to bow down before them; but if they are very numerous, admit that it will be unpleasant, eh?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2133">"Oh, don't let that worry you either," Raskolnikov continued in the same tone. "In general, a singularly small number of men are born with a new idea, or even capable of saying anything new. It is obvious that the distribution of births in the various categories and subdivisions of the human species must be strictly determined by some law of nature. This law, of course, is hidden from us today, but I believe that it exists and that it may even be known later. An enormous mass of people is on earth only to bring into the world, after long and mysterious crossings of races, a man who, among a thousand, will possess some independence. As the degree of independence increases, one encounters only one man in ten thousand, in a hundred thousand (these are approximate figures). There is a genius among several million individuals, and perhaps thousands of millions of men pass on the earth before one of those high intelligences arises that renews the face of the world. In short, I have not gone to look in the crucible where all this is done. But there is certainly and there must be a fixed law; chance cannot exist here."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2134">But come, you are both joking?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2135">"You are joking with each other, aren't you?" cried Razumihin at last. "You are trying to amuse each other at one another's expense. Are you serious, Rodya?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2136">Without answering, Raskolnikov raised his pale, suffering face to him. Looking at the calm and sad face of his friend, Razumikhin found it strange that Porfiry had adopted a caustic, provocative and impolite tone.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2137">“Well, my dear fellow, if it is serious, of course you are right in saying that it is not new and that it resembles everything we have read and heard a thousand times; but what is really original in it, what really belongs to you alone, I am sorry to say, is this moral right to shed blood that you grant and defend, pardon me, with such fanaticism… That, therefore, is the main idea of your article. This moral authorization to kill is, in my opinion, something more terrible than would be the official, legal authorization…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2138">"That is quite true," observed Porphyrius; "it is something more terrible, indeed."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2139">“No, your expression has exceeded your thought; it is not that you wanted to say! I will read your article… In conversation, sometimes one lets oneself be carried away! You cannot think that… I will read.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2140">"There is nothing of the sort in my article, I have scarcely touched on the question," said Raskolnikov.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2141">"Yes, yes," replied Porphyry, "now I understand more or less your way of looking at crime, but... excuse my insistence: if a young man imagines himself to be a Lycurgus or a Mohammed... future, that goes without saying, he will begin by removing all obstacles that would prevent him from fulfilling his mission... "I am embarking on a long campaign, he will say to himself, and for a campaign you need money..." On that, he will procure resources... you can guess how?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2142">Zametov, at these words, suddenly snorted in his corner. Raskolnikov did not even raise his eyes to him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2143">“I am obliged to admit,” he replied calmly, “that such cases must, in fact, occur. It is a trap that self-love sets for the vain and the foolish; young people especially are caught in it.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2144">— You see, then?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2145">"Well, what?" Raskolnikov laughed. "It's not my fault. It's always been so, and always will be. Just now he was reproaching me for justifying murder," he added, pointing to Razumihin.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2146">"What does it matter? Isn't society sufficiently protected by transportation, prisons, magistrates, galleys? Why worry, then? Find the thief!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2147">— And if we find it?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2148">"Too bad for him."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2149">— At least you are logical. But what will his conscience tell him?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2150">— What does it matter to you?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2151">— It is a question that concerns human feeling.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2152">— He who has a conscience suffers in acknowledging his error. That is his punishment, — apart from the galleys.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2153">"So," asked Razumikhin, frowning, "geniuses, those who are given the right to kill, should feel no suffering, even when they shed blood?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2154">"What has the word "must" to do with it? Suffering is neither permitted nor forbidden to them. They are free to suffer if they have pity for their victim... Suffering always accompanies a broad intelligence and a deep heart. Truly great men, it seems to me, must experience great sadness on earth," added Raskolnikov, seized by a sudden melancholy that contrasted with the tone of the previous conversation.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2155">He raised his eyes, looked at all the assistants with a dreamy air, smiled, and took his cap. He was too calm, compared to the attitude he had had when he entered, and he was aware of it. Everyone stood up.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2156">Porfiry Petrovitch returned to the charge.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2157">— Come, you will insult me or not, you will get angry or not, but it is stronger than me, I must ask you another little question ... Really, I am confused to abuse in this way ... While I think about it, and so as not to forget, I would like to share a little idea that came to me ...</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2158">"Well, tell me your little idea," replied Raskolnikov, standing up, pale and serious, facing the examining magistrate.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2159">— Here… really, I don't know how to express myself… it's a very strange idea… psychological… In composing your article, it is infinitely probable, he! he! that you considered yourself as one of those “extraordinary” men of whom you spoke… Come, isn't that true?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2160">"It's very possible," Raskolnikov answered disdainfully. Razumihin made a movement.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2161">— If that is so, would you not be determined yourself, — either to triumph over material embarrassments, or to make humanity progress, – would you not be determined to overcome the obstacle?… For example, to kill and steal?…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2162">At the same time he winked his left eye and laughed silently, just as he had done a moment ago.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2163">"If I were decided on that, I would not tell you," replied Raskolnikov, with a tone of haughty defiance.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2164">— My question was only for literary curiosity; I asked it only to better understand the meaning of your article.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2165">"Oh! how clumsy the trap is! What transparent malice!" thought Raskolnikov, disgusted.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2166">“Allow me to observe,” he replied dryly, “that I do not consider myself a Mohammed, a Napoleon… or any such character: consequently, I cannot inform you as to what I would do if I were in their place.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2167">"Come now! Who among us in Russia does not now take himself for a Napoleon?" said the examining magistrate with a brusque familiarity. This time the very intonation of his voice betrayed an ulterior motive.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2168">"Isn't it possible that a future Napoleon is the one who slapped our Alena Ivanovna last week?" Zametov suddenly blurted out from his corner.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2169">Without saying a word, Raskolnikov fixed Porfiry with a firm, penetrating gaze. Razumikhin's features became sullen. For some time now he had seemed to suspect something. He cast an irritated glance around him. For a minute a gloomy silence reigned. Raskolnikov prepared to leave.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2170">"You are going already!" said Porphyre graciously, extending his hand to the young man with extreme amiability.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2171">“I am delighted to have made your acquaintance. And as for your request, be at ease. Write in the sense that I have indicated. Or rather, do better: come and see me yourself… one of these days… tomorrow, for example. I will be<i class="calibre4">there</i>, without fail, at eleven o'clock. We'll settle everything. We'll have a little chat. As you are one of the last who have been there, you might perhaps tell us something, he added in a friendly tone.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2172">“You want to question me according to the rules?” Raskolnikov asked in a harsh tone.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2173">"Why?" he asked. "That is not the question now. You don't understand me. I am making use of every opportunity, and… and I have already talked with all those who had pawned things with the victim… several of them have given me useful information… and as you are the last… By the way!" he cried, with sudden joy, "it is very lucky I thought of it, I was going to forget it!… (Turning to Razumihin.) You were pestering me the other day about that Nikolashka… Well, I am convinced myself, I am convinced of his innocence," he went on, addressing Raskolnikov again. "But what is to be done? We had to trouble Mitka too… Now, here is what I wanted to ask you: when you went up the stairs… allow me, you came into the house between seven and eight o'clock, didn't you?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2174">"Yes," answered Raskolnikov, and immediately regretted the answer he had given, which he could have avoided.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2175">“Well! In going up the stairs between seven and eight o'clock, did you not see, on the second floor, in a room whose door was open, you remember? did you not see two workmen, or at least one of them? They were painting the apartment; did you not notice them? It is very important to them! …”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2176">Painters? No, I didn't see any," Raskolnikov replied slowly, as if trying to recall something. For a second he strained all his mental faculties to discover as quickly as possible what trap the examining magistrate was setting for him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2177">"No, I didn't see any, and I didn't even notice any open apartments," he continued, delighted to have discovered the clue; "but on the fourth floor I remember that the clerk who lived opposite Alyona Ivanovna was moving out; I remember that very well... I met some soldiers carrying a sofa, and I had to step aside against the wall... but painters, no, I don't remember seeing any... I don't even remember any apartment with the door open. No, I didn't see any..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2178">"But what are you talking about?" cried Razumihin, who had been listening attentively and thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2179">— It was on the very day of the murder that the painters were working in this apartment, and he came into the house two days before! Why do you ask him that?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2180">Why, that's true, I've confused the dates! Porphyry exclaimed, striking his forehead.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2181">“The devil take me! This business is driving me crazy!” he added by way of excuse, addressing Raskolnikov; “it is so important for us to know whether anyone saw them in the apartment between seven and eight o'clock that, without thinking further, I had believed I could obtain this information from you… I had completely confused the days!”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2182">“We must be more careful,” muttered Razumihin.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2183">These last words were spoken in the anteroom; Porfiry very amiably conducted his visitors to the door. They were gloomy and morose when they left the house, and they walked several steps without exchanging a word. Raskolnikov was breathing like a man who has just come through a painful ordeal.</p>
