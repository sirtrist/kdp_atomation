<h2 class="calibre7" id="h235">VII</h2>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4094">It was beginning to grow dark when he reached Sonia's. The girl had been waiting for him all day, in great anxiety. She had received Dounia's visit in the morning, and had heard from her that Svidrigaïlov had given her the address of Sonia's lodgings. She had hurried to the house, and had been waiting for him all the time. She had not slept all night, and had wept much. When she saw Raskolnikov she was overwhelmed with emotion. She embraced him and kissed him. He was greatly moved. She told him at once that Svidrigaïlov had been to see her that day and had insulted her. She did not blame him, and said that he was "a good man," but that he "must be suffering." Raskolnikov told her that Svidrigaïlov was a "miserable man," and that he "must be saved." Sonia was silent; she did not dare to ask him what he meant. He spoke to her kindly and affectionately, and told her that he was going away, that he had "nowhere to go," and that he would come and see her again. He asked her to be kind to his mother and to "watch over her." Sonia promised, and asked him to "take care of himself." They parted with tears, and Sonia set off to her work. She cried all the way. She felt very miserable. She had no one to rely upon, and she was frightened at the thought of being left alone. She knew that Raskolnikov would come back to her, but she felt afraid of him. She was afraid of his being angry with her, and of his hating her. She had a feeling that he would never come back.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4095">At last, Dounia decided to go and wait for her brother at his lodgings, thinking that he could not fail to pass that way. Sonia was no sooner left alone than the thought of the probable suicide of Raskolnikov took complete possession of her. It was the same fear that Dounia had. But, talking together, the two girls had given each other all sorts of reasons for being reassured, and they had succeeded in calming themselves in part.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4096">As soon as they parted, anxiety awoke in both of them. Sonia remembered what Svidrigailov had said to her the day before: "Raskolnikov has only two alternatives: to go to Siberia or..." Besides, she knew the young man's pride and his lack of religious feelings. "Is it possible that he resigned himself to live, only out of pusillanimity, out of fear of death?" she thought with despair. She no longer doubted that the unfortunate man had ended his life, when he entered her room.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4097">A cry of joy escaped the young girl's breast. But when she had observed the visitor's face more attentively, she suddenly turned pale.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4098">"Come, yes!" said Raskolnikov, laughing, "I have come for your crosses, Sonia. It was you who urged me to go to the crossroads; now that I am going there, why are you afraid?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4099">Sonia looked at him in amazement. This tone seemed strange to her; a shiver ran through her body; but, after a minute, she understood that this assurance was feigned. Raskolnikov, while speaking to her, looked into the corner and seemed afraid to fix his eyes on her.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4100">“You see, Sonia, I thought it would be better. There is a circumstance here… it would take too long to tell, and I don't have time. Do you know what irritates me? I feel furious at the thought that, in a moment, all these brutes will surround me, stare at me, ask me stupid questions that I will have to answer, point at me… You know, I won't go to Porphyry's; he is unbearable. I prefer to go to my friend Powder. How surprised he will be! I can count on a nice success of astonishment. But I should have more sang-froid; in recent times I have become very irritable. Would you believe it? Just now I almost showed my fist to my sister, and that because she turned around to see me one last time. Have I fallen low enough! Well, where are the crosses?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4101">The young man did not seem to be in his normal state. He could neither stay in one place for a minute nor fix his thoughts on an object; his ideas followed one another without transition, or, to put it better, he was rambling; his hands trembled slightly.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4102">Sonia kept silence. She took out of a box two crosses, one of cypress wood, the other of copper, and after signing herself, repeated the same ceremony over Raskolnikov, putting the cypress cross on his neck.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4103">“It's a symbolic way of saying that I'm taking up a cross, ha! ha! As if I'm only beginning to suffer today! The cypress cross is for the common people; the copper cross belonged to Elizabeth; you keep it for yourself, show it to me! So she was wearing it… at that moment? I know of two other religious objects: a silver cross and an image. I threw them then on the old woman's breast. That's what I should now put around my neck… But I'm talking nonsense and forgetting my business, I'm distracted!… You see, Sonia? I came mainly to warn you, so that you would know… Well, that's all… I came only for that. (Hum! I thought I had something else to tell you.) Come now, you yourself demanded that I take this step, I'm going to be put in prison, and your desire will be satisfied; why are you crying? You too! Stop, enough; oh! how painful all this is to me!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4104">At the sight of Sonia in tears, his heart contracted: "What am I to her?" he said to himself; "why does she care for me as my mother or Dounia might care? She will be my nurse!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4105">“Make the sign of the cross, say a little prayer,” the young girl begged in a trembling voice.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4106">"Oh, well, I'll pray as much as you like! And with all my heart, Sonia, with all my heart..."</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4107">That was not all he wanted to say.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4108">He made several signs of the cross. Sonia tied a green lady's handkerchief around her head, probably the same one that Marmeladov had spoken of at the tavern and which then served the whole family. This thought crossed Raskolnikov's mind, but he refrained from asking about it. He began to realize that he was constantly distracted and extremely troubled. This worried him. Suddenly he noticed that Sonia was preparing to go out with him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4109">What are you doing? Where are you going? Stay, stay! I want to be alone, he cried in an irritated voice, and he walked towards the door.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4110">"What need is there to go there with a whole retinue!" he grumbled as he went out.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4111">Sonia did not insist. He did not even say goodbye to her; he had forgotten her. One idea alone occupied him now:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4112">"Is it really all over?" he asked himself as he went down the stairs. "Is there no way of going back, of putting everything right... and not going there?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4113">Nevertheless, he continued on his way, suddenly realizing that the hour of hesitation was over. In the street he remembered that he had not said goodbye to Sonia, that she had stopped in the middle of the room, that an order from him had nailed her to her place. He then asked himself another question that had been haunting his mind for a few minutes without being clearly formulated:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4114">"Why did I pay her that visit? I told her I came on business: what business? I have none whatsoever. To tell her that "I am going there"? That was very necessary! To tell her that I love her? Come now! I have just now repulsed her like a dog. As for her cross, what need had I of it? Oh! how low I have fallen! No, what I needed were her tears; what I wanted was to enjoy the torments of her heart! Perhaps also, in going to see her, I sought only to gain time, to delay the fatal moment a little! And I dared to dream of high destinies, I believed myself called to do great things, I, so vile, so miserable, so cowardly!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4115">He was walking along the quay and had not far to go; but when he reached the bridge, he paused for a moment, then turned abruptly towards the Haymarket.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4116">His eyes darted eagerly to right and left, he tried to examine every object he met, and could not fix his attention on anything. "In eight days, in a month," he thought, "I shall pass over this bridge again; a cellular carriage will take me somewhere; with what eyes shall I then contemplate this canal? shall I still notice the signboard that is here? The word<i class="calibre4">Company</i>is written there: shall I read it then as I read it to-day? What will be my sensations and thoughts?... My God, how petty all these preoccupations are! No doubt this is curious... in its way... (Ha! ha! ha! what am I worrying about!) I am playing the child, I am posing in front of myself; why, in fact, should I blush at my thoughts? Oh! what a crowd! That fat man—a German, apparently—who has just pushed me, does he know whom he has elbowed? That woman who is holding a child by the hand and begging for alms perhaps believes me happier than she is. That would be funny. I ought to give her something, for the curiosity of the fact. Bah! I find I have five kopecks in my pocket, by what chance? There, take it, matushka!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4117">"God keep you!" said the beggar-woman in a tearful tone.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4118">Haymarket was then full of people. This circumstance greatly displeased Raskolnikov; nevertheless he directed his steps precisely to the spot where the crowd was densest. He would have bought solitude at any price, but he felt within himself that he could not enjoy it for a single minute. Arriving in the middle of the square, the young man suddenly recalled Sonia's words: “Go to the crossroads, salute the people, kiss the earth which you have defiled by your sin, and say aloud, in the face of the world:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4119">"I am a murderer!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4120">At this memory, he trembled all over. The anguish of the previous days had so dried up his soul that he was happy to find it still accessible to a sensation of another order and surrendered himself entirely to it. An immense tenderness took hold of him, his eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4121">He fell to his knees in the middle of the square, bent down to the ground, and kissed the muddy soil with joy. After standing up, he knelt down again.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4122">"There's one who didn't spare himself!" remarked a man next to him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4123">This observation was greeted with bursts of laughter.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4124">“He is a pilgrim going to Jerusalem, my friends; he is taking leave of his children, of his country; he is saluting everybody, he is kissing farewell to the city of Petersburg and to the soil of the capital,” added a citizen slightly affected by drink.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4125">"He is still very young," said a third.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4126">“He is a nobleman,” observed someone seriously.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4127">— Nowadays, one can no longer distinguish the noble from the non-noble.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4128">Seeing himself the object of general attention, Raskolnikov lost some of his assurance, and the words: "I killed," which were perhaps going to come out of his mouth, died on his lips. The exclamations, the jeers of the crowd left him indifferent, however, and it was with calm that he took the direction of the police station. On the way, only one vision attracted his gaze; moreover, he had expected to meet it on his way, and it did not surprise him.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4129">At the moment when, on the Haymarket, he had just prostrated himself for the second time to the ground, he had caught sight of Sonia fifty paces away. The young girl had tried to escape his sight by hiding behind one of the wooden booths which stand on the square. Thus she was accompanying him while he climbed this Calvary! From that moment Raskolnikov acquired the conviction that Sonia was his forever and would follow him everywhere, even if his destiny led him to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4130">Here he was at the fatal place. He entered the courtyard with a fairly firm step. The police office was on the third floor. "Before I go up there, I still have time to turn around," thought the young man. As long as he had not confessed, he liked to tell himself that he could change his mind.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4131">As on his first visit, he found the staircase littered with rubbish, and reeking with the fumes from the open kitchens on each landing. His legs were shaking as he climbed the stairs. He stopped for a moment to catch his breath, to collect himself, to prepare for his entrance. “But what for? Why?” he suddenly asked himself. “Since I have to drink this cup, it doesn't matter how I drink it. The more bitter it is, the better.” Then the image of Ilia Petrovich, the police lieutenant, came to his mind. “By the way, is it to him that I'm going to speak? Couldn't I speak to someone else, to Nikodim Fomitch, for example? If I went straight to the police commissioner at his private residence and told him the whole thing in a private conversation?... No, no! I'll speak to Poudre, it will be over sooner...”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4132">Shivering, hardly conscious of himself, Raskolnikov opened the door of the police station. This time, he saw only a dvornik and a man of the people in the anteroom. The attendant did not even pay attention to him. The young man went into the next room where two scribes were working. Zametov was not there, nor was Nikodim Fomitch.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4133">“Is there no one here?” the visitor asked one of the employees.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4134">— Who are you asking for?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4135">— A… a… ah! Without hearing his words, without seeing his face, I guessed the presence of a Russian… as it is said in some tale I can't remember… My respect! a familiar voice suddenly threw out.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4136">Raskolnikov started: Poudre was before him; he had just come out of a third room. "Fate has willed it," thought the visitor, "how is he here?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4137">“You here? What for?” cried Ilia Petrovitch, who seemed in a very good humor and even a little tipsy. “If you have come on business, it is too early. I am here by chance, in fact… Besides, what can I do for you… I confess I don't know you… What? What? Excuse me…”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4138">— Raskolnikoff.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4139">“Oh, yes, Raskolnikov! Could you have thought I had forgotten him? I beg you, don't think so if… Rodion… Ro… R… Rodionitch, isn't it?”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4140">— Rodion Romanitch.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4141">“Yes, yes, yes! Rodion Romanitch, Rodion Romanitch! I had it on the tip of my tongue. I confess that I sincerely regret the way we acted with you in the past… Later, things were explained to me; I learned that you were a young writer, a scientist even… I learned that you were starting out in the literary career… Eh! my God! what writer, what scientist, at the beginning, has not led a more or less bohemian life? My wife and I both appreciate literature; but, with my wife, it is a passion! She loves letters and the arts!… Except for birth, everything else can be acquired by talent, knowledge, intelligence, genius! A hat, for example, what does that mean? A hat is a hat, I buy it at Zimmermann; but what is under the hat, I do not buy!… I admit that I even wanted to come to your place to give you explanations; but I thought that perhaps you… With all this I do not ask you what is the purpose of your visit. It seems that your family is now in Petersburg?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4142">— Yes, my mother and my sister.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4143">"I have even had the honor and pleasure of meeting your sister," he continued, "a charming and distinguished person. I really regret with all my heart the altercation we had together in the past. As for the conjectures based on your fainting, their glaring falsehood has since been recognized. I understand the indignation you felt about them. Now that your family is living in Petersburg, you may perhaps be changing your lodgings?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4144">“N-no, not for the moment. I came to ask… I thought I would find Zamétoff here.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4145">"Ah, yes! I heard that you had become friends with him. Well, Zametov is no longer with us. Yes, we have lost Alexander Grigorievich! He left us yesterday; and before he left, there was even an exchange of harsh words between him and us... He is a little fop without any substance, nothing more; he had given some hopes, but he had the misfortune to frequent our brilliant youth, and he got it into his head to pass exams so that he could make trouble and pretend to be a scholar. Of course, Zametov has nothing in common with you, for example, or with Mr. Razumikhin, your friend. You others have embraced the career of science, and setbacks have no hold on you. In your eyes, the pleasures of life are nothing; you lead the austere, ascetic, monastic existence of the man of study. A book, a pen behind your ear, a scientific research to do, that is enough for your happiness! I myself, to a certain extent... Have you read Livingstone's correspondence?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4146">— No.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4147">— I have read it. Now, by the way, the number of nihilists has increased considerably, and it is not surprising, in an age like ours. Between you and me… no doubt, you are not a nihilist? Answer frankly, frankly!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4148">— N-no…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4149">"You know, don't be afraid to be frank with me as you would be with yourself! Another thing is the service, another thing... you thought I was going to say:<i class="calibre4">friendship</i>You are mistaken, sir! It is not friendship, but the feeling of the man and the citizen, the feeling of humanity and the love for the Almighty. I may be an official person, a functionary; I must not the less feel always in me the man and the citizen. You spoke of Zamétoff: well, Zamétoff is a boy who copies the French chic, who makes a noise in the bad places when he has drunk a glass of champagne or Don wine, — that is what your Zamétoff is! I may have been a little sharp with him; but if my indignation has carried me too far, it had its source in a high sentiment: the zeal for the interests of the service. Besides, I possess a rank, a situation, a social importance! I am married, father of a family. I fulfill my duty as a man and a citizen, while he, what is he, allow me to ask you? I address you as a man favored by the benefit of education. Look, the midwives have also multiplied beyond all measure.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4150">Raskolnikov looked at the lieutenant with a bewildered air. The words of Ilya Petrovitch, who was evidently coming out of the tavern, sounded to him for the most part like empty sounds. However, he understood some of them. At this moment he was looking questioningly at his interlocutor and did not know how it would all end.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4151">"I mean those young girls who wear their hair cut à la Titus," continued the indefatigable Ilia Petrovitch, "I call them midwives, and the name seems to me very well chosen. Ha! ha! They take medical courses, they study anatomy; come, tell me, if I were to fall ill, would I let myself be treated by a young lady? Ha! ha!"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4152">Ilia Petrovitch laughed, delighted with his wit.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4153">"I admit the thirst for knowledge; but can one not acquire knowledge without indulging in all these excesses? Why be insolent? Why insult noble personalities, as this scoundrel Zametov does? Why did he insult me, I ask you? ... Another epidemic that is making terrible progress is suicide. They eat up everything they have, and then they kill themselves. Little girls, young men, old men kill themselves! ... Look! we just learned that a gentleman who had recently arrived here had just ended his life. Nil Pavlitch, eh! Nil Pavlitch! what was the name of the gentleman who blew his brains out this morning in the Petersburgskaya?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4154">“Svidrigaïlov,” a hoarse voice answered from the next room.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4155">Raskolnikov shivered.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4156">"Svidrigaïloff! Svidrigaïloff has blown his brains out!" he exclaimed.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4157">"How is that? You knew Svidrigaïlov?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4158">"Yes, I knew him. He had only recently arrived here."</p>

<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4160">— I… my sister had been a governess in his house.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4161">"Bah! bah! bah!... But then you can give us some information about him. You had no suspicion of his plan?"</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4162">“I saw him yesterday… he was drinking wine… I suspected nothing.”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4163">Raskolnikov felt as if a mountain were on his chest.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4164">— You seem to be paling again. The atmosphere in this room is so stifling…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4165">“Yes, it is time for me to go,” stammered the visitor, “excuse me, I have disturbed you…”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4166">— Come, come, I am always at your service! You have pleased me, and I am very glad to declare to you…</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4167">As he said this, Ilia Petrovich extended his hand to the young man.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4168">“I only wanted… I was dealing with Zametov…”</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4169">— I understand, I understand… delighted to have you visit.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4170">"I am... delighted... goodbye," said Raskolnikov with a smile.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4171">He went out with a staggering step. His head was whirling. He could scarcely stand, and as he went down the stairs he had to hold on to the wall to keep from falling. It seemed to him that a dvornik, who was going to the police station, jostled him as he passed; that a dog was barking somewhere on the first floor, and that a woman was screaming to make the animal stop. When he reached the bottom of the stairs, he went into the yard. Sonia, standing near the door, pale as death, was looking at him with a strange expression. He stopped in front of her. The girl struck her hands together; her face expressed the most dreadful despair. At this sight, Raskolnikov smiled, but what a smile! A moment later he was back in the police station.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4172">Ilia Petrovitch was rummaging among some papers. Before him stood the same moujik who had jostled Raskolnikov on the stairs.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4173">— A-a-ah ! You're back! You forgot something?… But what's wrong with you?</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4174">With pale lips and a fixed gaze, Raskolnikov slowly approached Ilya Petrovitch. Leaning his hand on the table in front of which the lieutenant was sitting, he tried to speak, but could only utter unintelligible sounds.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4175">— You are ill, a chair! Here, sit down! some water!</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4176">Raskolnikov sank into the chair that was offered him, but his eyes never left Ilya Petrovich, whose face expressed a very unpleasant surprise. For a minute they looked at each other in silence. Water was brought.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4177">"It is I," began Raskolnikov.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4178">— Drink.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4179">The young man waved away the glass that was offered him, and, in a low but distinct voice, he made, interrupting himself several times, the following statement:</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4180"></p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4181"><i class="calibre4">“It was I who murdered the old pawnbroker and her sister Elizabeth with an axe, in order to rob them.”</i></p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4182">Ilia Petrovitch called. People came running from all sides.</p>
<p class="firstpara-rw" id="p4183">Raskolnikov renewed his confession.</p>
